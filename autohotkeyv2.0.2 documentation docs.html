Acknowledgements
A special thanks to Jonathan Bennett, whose generosity in releasing AutoIt v2 as free software in 1999 served as an inspiration and time-saver for myself and many others worldwide. In addition, many of AutoHotkey's enhancements to the AutoIt v2 command set, as well as the Window Spy and the old script compiler, were adapted directly from the AutoIt v3 source code. So thanks to Jon and the other AutoIt authors for those as well.

Finally, AutoHotkey would not be what it is today without these other individuals.

<h1>Debugging Clients</h1>

<p>Additional debugging features are supported via <a href="https://xdebug.org/docs/dbgp">DBGp</a>, a common debugger protocol for languages and debugger UI communication. See <a href="Scripts.htm#idebug">Interactive Debugging</a> for more details. Some UIs or "clients" known to be compatible with AutoHotkey are listed on this page:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#SciTE4AutoHotkey">SciTE4AutoHotkey</a></li>
  <li><a href="#XDebugClient">XDebugClient</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Notepad++">Notepad++ DBGp Plugin</a></li>
  <li><a href="#dbgp.ahk">Script-based Clients</a></li>
  <li><a href="#command-line-client">Command-line Client</a></li>
  <li><a href="#others">Others</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="SciTE4AutoHotkey">SciTE4AutoHotkey</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/scite4ahk/">SciTE4AutoHotkey</a> is a free, <a href="https://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html">SciTE</a>-based AutoHotkey script editor. In addition to DBGp support, it provides syntax highlighting, calltips/parameter info and auto-complete for AutoHotkey, and other useful editing features and scripting tools.</p>
<p>Debugging features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Breakpoints.</li>
  <li>Run, Step Over/Into/Out.</li>
  <li>View the call stack.</li>
  <li>List name and contents of variables in local/global scope.</li>
  <li>Hover over variable to show contents.</li>
  <li>Inspect or edit variable contents.</li>
  <li>View structure of objects.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/scite4ahk/">https://www.autohotkey.com/scite4ahk/</a></p>

<h2 id="VSCode">Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug">vscode-autohotkey-debug</a> extension enables <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to act as a debugger client for AutoHotkey. The extension has support for all basic debugging features as well as some more advanced features, such as breakpoint directives (as comments) and conditional breakpoints.</p>

<h2 id="XDebugClient">XDebugClient</h2>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/xdebugclient/">XDebugClient</a> is a simple open-source front-end DBGp client based on the <b>.NET Framework 2.0</b>. XDebugClient was originally designed for PHP with Xdebug, but a custom build compatible with AutoHotkey is available below.</p>
<p><b>Changes:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow the debugger engine to report a language other than "php".</li>
  <li>Added AutoHotkey syntax highlighting.</li>
  <li>Automatically listen for a connection from the debugger engine, rather than waiting for the user to click <em>Start Listening</em>.</li>
  <li>Truncate property values at the first null-character, since AutoHotkey currently returns the entire variable contents and XDebugClient has no suitable interface for displaying binary content.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Download:</b> <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/download/tools/XDebugClient.zip">Binary</a>; <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/download/tools/XDebugClient_src.zip">Source Code</a> (also see <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode">SharpDevelop</a>, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dockpanelsuite/">Dockpanel Suite</a> and <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14741/Advanced-TreeView-for-NET">Advanced TreeView</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Usage:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Launch XDebugClient.</li>
  <li>Launch AutoHotkey /Debug. XDebugClient should automatically open the script file.</li>
  <li>Click the left margin to set at least one breakpoint.</li>
  <li>Choose Run from the Debug menu, or press <kbd>F5</kbd>.</li>
  <li>When execution hits a breakpoint, use the Debug menu or shortcut keys to step through or resume the script.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Features:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighted, read-only view of the source code.</li>
  <li>Breakpoints.</li>
  <li>Run, Step Over/Into/Out.</li>
  <li>View the call stack.</li>
  <li>Inspect variables - select a variable name, right-click, Inspect.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Issues:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The user interface does not respond to user input while the script is running.</li>
  <li>No mechanisms are provided to list variables or set their values.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Notepad++">Notepad++ DBGp Plugin</h2>
<p>A DBGp client is available as a plugin for <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> <strong>32-bit</strong>. It is designed for PHP, but also works with AutoHotkey. The plugin has not been updated since 2012, and is not available for Notepad++ 64-bit.</p>
<p><b>Download:</b> See <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/files/DBGP%20Plugin/">DBGp plugin for Notepad++</a>.</p>
<p><b>Usage:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Launch Notepad++.</li>
  <li>Configure the DBGp plugin via <i>Plugins</i>, <i>DBGp</i>, <i>Config...</i>
    <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> File Mapping must be configured.  Most users will not be debugging remotely, and therefore may simply put a checkmark next to <i>Bypass all mapping (local windows setup)</i>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Show the debugger pane via the toolbar or <b>Plugins</b>, <b>DBGp</b>, <b>Debugger</b>.</li>
  <li>Open the script file to be debugged.</li>
  <li>Set at least one breakpoint.</li>
  <li>Launch AutoHotkey /Debug.</li>
  <li>Use the debugger toolbar or shortcut keys to control the debugger.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Features:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting, if configured by the user.</li>
  <li>Breakpoints.</li>
  <li>Run, Step Over/Into/Out, Run to cursor, Stop.</li>
  <li>View local/global variables.</li>
  <li>Watch user-specified variables.</li>
  <li>View the call stack.</li>
  <li>Hover over a variable to view its contents.</li>
  <li>User-configurable shortcut keys - Settings, Shortcut Mapper..., Plugin commands.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Issues:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Hovering over a single-letter variable name does not work - for instance, hovering over <code>a</code> will attempt to retrieve <code> a</code> or <code>a </code>.</li>
  <li>Hovering over text will attempt to retrieve a variable even if the text contains invalid characters.</li>
  <li>Notepad++ becomes unstable if property_get fails, which is particularly problematic in light of the above. As a workaround, AutoHotkey sends an empty property instead of an error code when a non-existent or invalid variable is requested.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dbgp.ahk">Script-based Clients</h2>
<p>A script-based DBGp library and example clients are available from GitHub.</p><ul>
  <li>dbgp_console.ahk: Simple command-line client.</li>
  <li>dbgp_test.ahk: Demonstrates asynchronous debugging.</li>
  <li>dbgp_listvars.ahk: Example client which justs lists the variables of all running scripts.</li>
</ul>
<p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Lexikos/dbgp">Lexikos / <strong>dbgp</strong></a></p>
<p>The DebugVars script provides a graphical user interface for inspecting and changing the contents of variables and objects in any running script (except compiled scripts). It also serves as a demonstration of the dbgp.ahk library.</p>
<p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Lexikos/DebugVars.ahk#debugvars">Lexikos / <strong>DebugVars</strong></a></p>

<h2 id="command-line-client">Command-line Client</h2>
<p>A command-line client is available from <a href="https://xdebug.org/">xdebug.org</a>, however this is not suitable for most users as it requires a decent understanding of DBGp (the protocol).</p>

<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>A number of other DBGp clients are available, but have not been tested with AutoHotkey. For a list, see <a href="https://xdebug.org/docs/remote">Xdebug: Documentation</a>.</p>

<h1>Binary Compatibility</h1>

<p>This document contains some topics which are sometimes important when dealing with external libraries or sending messages to a control or window.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#Format">Unicode vs ANSI</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#Buffer">Buffer</a></li>
      <li><a href="#DllCall">DllCall</a></li>
      <li><a href="#NumPutGet">NumPut / NumGet</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#ptr">Pointer Size</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Format">Unicode vs ANSI</h2>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This section builds on topics covered in other parts of the documentation: <a href="Concepts.htm#strings">Strings</a>, <a href="Concepts.htm#string-encoding">String Encoding</a>.</p>
<p>Within a string (text value), the numeric character code and size (in bytes) of each character depends on the <a href="Concepts.htm#string-encoding">encoding</a> of the string. These details are typically important for scripts which do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pass strings to external functions via <a href="#DllCall">DllCall</a>.</li>
  <li>Pass strings via <a href="lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a> or <a href="lib/SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>.</li>
  <li>Manipulate strings directly via <a href="#NumPutGet">NumPut/NumGet</a>.</li>
  <li>Allocate a <a href="#Buffer">Buffer</a> to hold a specific number of characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>AutoHotkey v2 natively uses Unicode (UTF-16), but some external libraries or window messages might require ANSI strings.</p>
<p><strong>ANSI:</strong> Each character is <strong>one byte</strong> (8 bits).  Character codes above 127 depend on your system's language settings (or the codepage chosen when the text was encoded, such as when it is written to a file).</p>
<p><strong>Unicode:</strong> Each character is <strong>two bytes</strong> (16 bits).  Character codes are as defined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF-16</a> format.</p>
<p class="Indent"><em>Semantic note:</em> Technically, some Unicode characters are represented by <i>two</i> 16-bit code units, collectively known as a "surrogate pair."  Similarly, some <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/intl/code-pages">ANSI code pages</a> (commonly known as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/intl/double-byte-character-sets">Double Byte Character Sets</a>) contain some double-byte characters.  However, for practical reasons these are almost always treated as two individual units (referred to as "characters" for simplicity).</p>

<h3 id="Buffer">Buffer</h3>
<p>When allocating a <a href="lib/Buffer.htm">Buffer</a>, take care to calculate the correct number of <em>bytes</em> for whichever encoding is required. For example:</p>
<pre>ansi_buf  := Buffer(capacity_in_chars)
utf16_buf := Buffer(capacity_in_chars * 2)</pre>
<p>If an ANSI or UTF-8 string will be written into the buffer with <a href="lib/StrPut.htm">StrPut</a>, do not use <a href="lib/StrLen.htm">StrLen</a> to determine the buffer size, as the ANSI or UTF-8 length may differ from the native (UTF-16) length. Instead, use <a href="lib/StrPut.htm#ExEncoding">StrPut</a> to calculate the required buffer size. For example:</p>
<pre>required_bytes := StrPut(source_string, "cp0")
ansi_buf := Buffer(required_bytes)
StrPut(source_string, ansi_buf)</pre>

<h3 id="DllCall">DllCall</h3>
<p>When the "Str" type is used, it means a string in the native format of the current build.  Since some functions may require or return strings in a particular format, the following string types are available:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th class="center">Char Size</th><th>C / Win32 Types</th><th>Encoding</th></tr>
  <tr><td class="Syntax center">WStr</td><td class="center">16-bit</td><td>wchar_t*, WCHAR*, LPWSTR, LPCWSTR</td><td>UTF-16</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="Syntax center">AStr</td><td class="center">8-bit</td><td>char*, CHAR*, LPSTR, LPCSTR</td><td>ANSI (the system default ANSI code page)</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="Syntax center">Str</td><td class="center">--</td><td>TCHAR*, LPTSTR, LPCTSTR</td><td>Equivalent to <b>WStr</b> in AutoHotkey v2.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>If "Str" or "WStr" is used for a parameter, the address of the string is passed to the function. For "AStr", a temporary ANSI copy of the string is created and its address is passed instead. As a general rule, "AStr" should not be used for an output parameter since the buffer is only large enough to hold the input string.</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> "AStr" and "WStr" are equally valid for parameters and the function's return value.</p>
<p>In general, if a script calls a function via DllCall which accepts a string as a parameter, one or more of the following approaches must be taken:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If both Unicode (W) and ANSI (A) versions of the function are available, omit the W or A suffix and use the "Str" type for input parameters or the return value. For example, the DeleteFile function is exported from kernel32.dll as <code>DeleteFileA</code> and <code>DeleteFileW</code>. Since <code>DeleteFile</code> itself doesn't really exist, DllCall automatically tries <code>DeleteFileW</code>:
  <pre>DllCall("DeleteFile", "Ptr", StrPtr(filename))
DllCall("DeleteFile", "Str", filename)</pre>
  <p>In both cases, the address of the original unmodified string is passed to the function.</p>
  <p>In some cases this approach may backfire, as DllCall adds the W suffix only if no function could be found with the original name. For example, shell32.dll exports ExtractIconExW, ExtractIconExA and ExtractIconEx with no suffix, with the last two being equivalent. In that case, omitting the W suffix causes the ANSI version to be called.</p></li>
  <li>If the function accepts a specific type of string as input, the script may use the appropriate string type:
  <pre>DllCall("DeleteFileA", "AStr", filename)
DllCall("DeleteFileW", "WStr", filename)</pre></li>
  <li>If the function has a string parameter used for output, the script must allocate a buffer as described <a href="#Buffer">above</a> and pass it to the function. If the parameter accepts input, the script must also convert the input string to the appropriate format; <a href="lib/StrPut.htm">StrPut</a> can be used for this.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="NumPutGet">NumPut / NumGet</h3>
<p>When NumPut or NumGet are used with strings, the offset and type must be correct for the given type of string.  The following may be used as a guide:</p>
<pre><em>;  8-bit/ANSI   strings:  size_of_char=1  type_of_char="UChar"
; 16-bit/UTF-16 strings:  size_of_char=2  type_of_char="UShort"</em>
<i>n</i>th_char := NumGet(buffer_or_address, (<i>n</i>-1)*size_of_char, type_of_char)
NumPut(type_of_char, <i>n</i>th_char, buffer_or_address, (<i>n</i>-1)*size_of_char)</pre>
<p>For the first character, <em>n</em> should have the value 1.</p>

<h2 id="ptr">Pointer Size</h2>
<p>Pointers are 4 bytes in 32-bit builds and 8 bytes in 64-bit builds. Scripts using structures or DllCalls may need to account for this to run correctly on both platforms. Specific areas which are affected include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Offset calculation for fields in structures which contain one or more pointers.</li>
  <li>Size calculation for structures containing one or more pointers.</li>
  <li>Type names used with <a href="lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>, <a href="lib/NumPut.htm">NumPut</a> or <a href="lib/NumGet.htm">NumGet</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For size and offset calculations, use <a href="Variables.htm#PtrSize">A_PtrSize</a>. For DllCall, NumPut and NumGet, use the <a href="lib/DllCall.htm">Ptr</a> type where appropriate.</p>
<p>Remember that the offset of a field is usually the total size of all fields preceding it. Also note that handles (including types like HWND and HBITMAP) are essentially pointer-types.</p>

<h2 id="values">Values</h2>
<p>A <em>value</em> is simply a piece of information within a program. For example, the name of a key to send or a program to run, the number of times a hotkey has been pressed, the title of a window to activate, or whatever else has some meaning within the program or script.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey supports these types of values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#strings">Strings</a> (text)</li>
  <li><a href="#numbers">Numbers</a> (integers and floating-point numbers)</li>
  <li><a href="#objects">Objects</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="lib/Type.htm">Type</a> function can be used to determine the type of a value.</p>
<p>Some other related concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#boolean">Boolean</a></li>
  <li><a href="#nothing">Nothing</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="strings">Strings</h3>
<p>A <em>string</em> is simply text. Each string is actually a sequence or <em>string</em> of characters, but can be treated as a single entity. The <em>length</em> of a string is the number of characters in the sequence, while the <em>position</em> of a character in the string is merely that character's sequential number. By convention in AutoHotkey, the first character is at position 1.</p>
<p id="numeric-strings"><strong>Numeric strings:</strong> A string of digits (or any other supported <a href="#numbers">number format</a>) is automatically interpreted as a number when a math operation or comparison requires it.</p>
<p>How literal text should be written within the script depends on the context. For instance, in an expression, <a href="Language.htm#strings">strings</a> must be enclosed in quotation marks. In directives (excluding #HotIf) and auto-replace hotstrings, quotation marks are not needed.</p>
<p>For a more detailed explanation of how strings work, see <a href="#string-encoding">String Encoding</a>.</p>

<h3 id="numbers">Numbers</h3>
<p>AutoHotkey supports these number formats:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decimal integers, such as <code>123</code>, <code>00123</code> or <code>-1</code>.</li>
  <li>Hexadecimal integers, such as <code>0x7B</code>, <code>0x007B</code> or <code>-0x1</code>.</li>
  <li>Decimal floating-point numbers, such as <code>3.14159</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hexadecimal numbers must use the <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code> prefix, except where noted in the documentation. This prefix must be written after the <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> sign, if present, and before any leading zeroes. For example, <code>0x001</code> is valid, but <code>000x1</code> is not.</p>
<p>Numbers written with a decimal point are always considered to be floating-point, even if the fractional part is zero. For example, <code>42</code> and <code>42.0</code> are usually interchangeable, but not always. Scientific notation is also recognized (e.g. <code>1.0e4</code> and <code>-2.1E-4</code>), but always produces a floating-point number even if no decimal point is present.</p>
<p>The decimal separator is always a dot, even if the user's regional settings specify a comma.</p>
<p id="number-default-format">When a number is converted to a string, it is formatted as decimal. Floating-point numbers are formatted with full precision (but discarding redundant trailing zeroes), which may in some cases reveal their <a href="#float-imprecision">inaccuracy</a>. Use the <a href="lib/Format.htm">Format</a> function to produce a numeric string in a different format. Floating-point numbers can also be formatted by using the <a href="lib/Math.htm#Round">Round</a> function.</p>
<p>For details about the range and accuracy of numeric values, see <a href="#pure-numbers">Pure Numbers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="boolean">Boolean</h3>
<p>A <em>boolean</em> value can be either <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>. Boolean values are used to represent anything that has exactly two possible states, such as the <em>truth</em> of an expression. For example, the expression <code>(x &lt;= y)</code> is <em>true</em> when x has lesser or equal value to y. A boolean value could also represent <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em>, <em>on</em> or <em>off</em>, <em>down</em> or <em>up</em> (such as for <a href="lib/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a>) and so on.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey does not have a specific boolean type, so it uses the integer value <code>0</code> to represent false and <code>1</code> to represent true. When a value is required to be either true or false, a blank or zero value is considered false and all other values are considered true. (Objects are always considered true.)</p>
<p>The words <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are <a href="#built-in-variables">built-in variables</a> containing 1 and 0. They can be used to make a script more readable.</p>

<h3 id="nothing">Nothing</h3>
<p>AutoHotkey does not have a value which uniquely represents <em>nothing</em>, <em>null</em>, <em>nil</em> or <em>undefined</em>, as seen in other languages.</p>
<p>Instead of producing a "null" or "undefined" value, any attempt to read a variable, property, array element or map item which has no value causes an <a href="lib/Error.htm#UnsetError">UnsetError</a> to be thrown. This allows errors to be identified more easily than if a null value was implicitly allowed to propagate through the code. See also: <a href="#uninitialized-variables">Uninitialized Variables</a>.</p>
<p>A function's <a href="Language.htm#optional-parameters">optional parameters</a> can be <em>omitted</em> when the function is called, in which case the function may change its behaviour or use a default value. Parameters are usually omitted by literally omitting them from the code, but can also be omitted explicitly or conditionally by using the <code>unset</code> keyword. This special signal can only be propagated explicitly, with the <a href="Variables.htm#maybe">maybe operator (<em>var</em><strong>?</strong>)</a>. An unset parameter automatically receives its default value (if any) before the function executes.</p>
<p>Mainly for historical reasons, an empty string is sometimes used wherever a null or undefined value would be used in other languages, such as for functions which have no explicit return value.</p>
<p>If a <a href="#variables">variable</a> or <a href="#parameters">parameter</a> is said to be "empty" or "blank", that usually means an empty string (a string of zero length). This is not the same as omitting a parameter, although it may have the same effect in some cases.</p>

<h3 id="objects">Objects</h3>
<p>The <em>object</em> is AutoHotkey's composite or abstract data type. An object can be composed of any number of <em>properties</em> (which can be retrieved or set) and <a href="#methods"><em>methods</em></a> (which can be called). The name and effect of each property or method depends on the specific object or type of object.</p>
<p>Objects have the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Objects are not contained; they are <a href="#references-to-objects">referenced</a>. For example, <code>alpha := []</code> creates a new <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> and stores a reference in <em>alpha</em>. <code>bravo := alpha</code> copies the reference (not the object) to <code>bravo</code>, so both refer to the same object. When an array or variable is said to contain an object, what it actually contains is a reference to the object.</li>
  <li>Two object references compare equal only if they refer to the same object.</li>
  <li>Objects are always considered <i>true</i> when a boolean value is required, such as in <code>if obj</code>, <code>!obj</code> or <code>obj ? x : y</code>.</li>
  <li>Each object has a unique address (location in memory), which can be retrieved by the <a href="Objects.htm#ObjPtr">ObjPtr</a> function, but is typically not used directly. This address uniquely identifies the object, but only until the object is freed.</li>
  <li>In some cases when an object is used in a context where one was not expected, it might be treated as an empty string. For example, <code>MsgBox(myObject)</code> shows an empty MsgBox. In other cases, a <a href="lib/Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a> may be thrown (and this should become the norm in future).</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> All objects which derive from <a href="lib/Object.htm">Object</a> have additional shared behaviour, properties and methods.</p>
<p>Some ways that objects are used include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To contain a collection of items or <em>elements</em>. For example, an <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> contains a sequence of items, while a <a href="lib/Map.htm">Map</a> associates keys with values. Objects allow a group of values to be treated as one value, to be assigned to a single variable, passed to or returned from a function, and so on.</li>
  <li>To represent something real or conceptual. For example: a position on the screen, with X and Y properties; a contact in an address book, with Name, PhoneNumber, EmailAddress and so on. Objects can be used to represent more complex sets of information by combining them with other objects.</li>
  <li>To encapsulate a service or set of services, allowing other parts of the script to focus on a task rather than how that task is carried out. For example, a <a href="lib/File.htm">File</a> object provides methods to read data from a file or write data to a file. If a script function which writes information to a file accepts a File object as a parameter, it needs not know how the file was opened. The same function could be reused to write information to some other target, such as a TCP/IP socket or WebSocket (via user-defined objects).</li>
  <li>A combination of the above. For example, a <a href="lib/Gui.htm">Gui</a> represents a GUI window; it provides a script with the means to create and display a graphical user interface; it contains a collection of controls, and provides information about the window via properties such as Title and FocusedCtrl.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proper use of objects (and in particular, <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes">classes</a>) can result in code which is <em>modular</em> and <em>reusable</em>. Modular code is usually easier to test, understand and maintain. For instance, one can improve or modify one section of code without having to know the details of other sections, and without having to make corresponding changes to those sections. Reusable code saves time, by avoiding the need to write and test code for the same or similar tasks over and over.</p>

<h3 id="object-protocol">Object Protocol</h3>
<p class="note">This section builds on these concepts which are covered in later sections: <a href="#variables">variables</a>, <a href="#functions">functions</a></p>
<p>Objects work through the principle of <em>message passing</em>. You don't know where an object's code or variables actually reside, so you must pass a message to the object, like "give me <em>foo</em>" or "go do <em>bar</em>", and rely on the object to respond to the message. Objects in AutoHotkey support the following basic messages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Get</strong> a property.</li>
  <li><strong>Set</strong> a property, denoted by <code>:=</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Call</strong> a <a href="#methods">method</a>, denoted by <code>()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>property</em> is simply some aspect of the object that can be set and/or retrieved. For example, <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> has a <a href="lib/Array.htm#Length">Length</a> property which corresponds to the number of elements in the array. If you define a property, it can have whatever meaning you want. Generally a property acts like a <a href="#variables">variable</a>, but its value might be calculated on demand and not actually stored anywhere.</p>
<p>Each message contains the following, usually written where the property or method is <a href="#call">called</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the property or method.</li>
  <li>Zero or more <a href="#parameters">parameters</a> which may affect what action is carried out, how a value is stored, or which value is returned. For example, a property might take an array index or key.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
myObj.methodName(arg1)
value := myObj.propertyName[arg1]
</pre>
<p>An object may also have a <em>default</em> property, which is invoked when square brackets are used without a property name. For example:</p>
<pre>value := myObj[arg1]</pre>
<p>Generally, <strong>Set</strong> has the same meaning as an assignment, so it uses the same operator:</p>
<pre>
myObj.name := value
myObj.name[arg1, arg2, ..., argN] := value
myObj[arg1, arg2, ..., argN] := value
</pre>

<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>A variable allows you to use a name as a placeholder for a value. Which value that is could change repeatedly during the time your script is running. For example, a hotkey could use a variable <code>press_count</code> to count the number of times it is pressed, and send a different key whenever <code>press_count</code> is a multiple of 3 (every third press). Even a variable which is only assigned a value once can be useful. For example, a <code>WebBrowserTitle</code> variable could be used to make your code easier to update when and if you were to change your preferred web browser, or if the <a href="misc/WinTitle.htm">title</a> or <a href="misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_class">window class</a> changes due to a software update.</p>
<p>In AutoHotkey, variables are created simply by using them. Each variable is <em>not</em> permanently restricted to a single <a href="#values">data type</a>, but can instead hold a value of any type: string, number or object. Attempting to read a variable which has not been assigned a value is considered an error, so it is important to <a href="#uninitialized-variables">initialize variables</a>.</p>
<p>A variable has three main aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The variable's <em>name</em>.</li>
  <li>The variable itself.</li>
  <li>The variable's <em>value</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain restrictions apply to variable names - see <a href="#names">Names</a> for details. In short, it is safest to stick to names consisting of ASCII letters (which are case insensitive), digits and underscore, and to avoid using names that start with a digit.</p>
<p id="scope">A variable name has <strong><em>scope</em></strong>, which defines where in the code that name can be used to refer to that particular variable; in other words, where the variable is <em>visible</em>. If a variable is not visible within a given scope, the same name can refer to a different variable. Both variables might exist at the same time, but only one is visible to each part of the script. <a href="Functions.htm#Global">Global variables</a> are visible in the "global scope" (that is, outside of functions), and can be read by functions by default, but must be <a href="Functions.htm#Global">declared</a> if they are to be assigned a value inside a function. <a href="Functions.htm#Local">Local variables</a> are visible only inside the function which created them.</p>
<p>A variable can be thought of as a container or storage location for a value, so you'll often find the documentation refers to a variable's value as <em>the contents of the variable</em>. For a variable <code>x := 42</code>, we can also say that the variable x has the number 42 as its value, or that the value of x is 42.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a variable and its value are not the same thing. For instance, we might say "<code>myArray</code> is an array", but what we really mean is that myArray is a variable containing a reference to an array. We're taking a shortcut by using the name of the variable to refer to its value, but "myArray" is really just the name of the variable; the array object doesn't know that it has a name, and could be referred to by many different variables (and therefore many names).</p>

<h3 id="uninitialized-variables"><span id="uninitialised-variables"></span>Uninitialized Variables</h3>
<p>To <em>initialize</em> a variable is to assign it a starting value. A variable which has not yet been assigned a value is <em>uninitialized</em> (or <em>unset</em> for short). Attempting to read an uninitialized variable is considered an error. This helps to detect errors such as mispelled names and forgotten assignments.</p>
<p><a href="lib/IsSet.htm">IsSet</a> can be used to determine whether a variable has been initialized, such as to initialize a global or static variable on first use.</p>
<p>A variable can be <em>un-set</em> by combining a direct assignment (<code>:=</code>) with the <code>unset</code> keyword or the <a href="Variables.htm#maybe">maybe (<em>var</em>?)</a> operator. For example: <code>Var := unset</code>, <code>Var1 := (Var2?)</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Variables.htm#or-maybe">or-maybe operator (??)</a> can be used to provide a default value when a variable lacks a value. For example, <code>MyVar ?? "Default"</code> is equivalent to <code>IsSet(MyVar) ? MyVar : "Default"</code>.</p>

<h3 id="built-in-variables">Built-in Variables</h3>
<p>A number of useful variables are built into the program and can be referenced by any script. Except where noted, these variables are read-only; that is, their contents cannot be directly altered by the script. By convention, most of these variables start with the prefix <code>A_</code>, so it is best to avoid using this prefix for your own variables.</p>
<p>Some variables such as <a href="Variables.htm#KeyDelay">A_KeyDelay</a> and <a href="Variables.htm#TitleMatchMode">A_TitleMatchMode</a> represent settings that control the script's behavior, and retain separate values for each <a href="misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>. This allows subroutines launched by new threads (such as for hotkeys, menus, timers and such) to change settings without affecting other threads.</p>
<p>Some special variables are not updated periodically, but rather their value is retrieved or calculated whenever the script references the variable. For example, <a href="lib/A_Clipboard.htm">A_Clipboard</a> retrieves the current contents of the clipboard as text, and <a href="Variables.htm#TimeSinceThisHotkey">A_TimeSinceThisHotkey</a> calculates the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the hotkey was pressed.</p>
<p>Related: <a href="Variables.htm#BuiltIn">list of built-in variables</a>.</p>

<h3 id="environment-variables">Environment Variables</h3>
<p>Environment variables are maintained by the operating system. You can see a list of them at the command prompt by typing SET then pressing Enter.</p>
<p>A script may create a new environment variable or change the contents of an existing one with <a href="lib/EnvSet.htm">EnvSet</a>. Such additions and changes are not seen by the rest of the system. However, any programs or scripts which the script launches by calling <a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> or <a href="lib/Run.htm">RunWait</a> usually inherit a copy of the parent script's environment variables.</p>
<p>To retrieve an environment variable, use <a href="lib/EnvGet.htm">EnvGet</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>Path := EnvGet("PATH")</pre>

<h3 id="variable-references">Variable References (VarRef)</h3>
<p>Within an expression, each variable reference is automatically resolved to its contents, unless it is the target of an <a href="Variables.htm#AssignOp">assignment</a> or the <a href="Variables.htm#ref">reference operator (&amp;)</a>. In other words, calling <code>myFunction(myVar)</code> would pass the value of <em>myVar</em> to <em>myFunction</em>, not the variable itself. The function would then have its own local variable (the parameter) with the same value as <em>myVar</em>, but would not be able to assign a new value to <em>myVar</em>. In short, the parameter is passed <em>by value</em>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Variables.htm#ref">reference operator (&amp;)</a> allows a variable to be handled like a value. <code>&amp;myVar</code> produces a VarRef, which can be used like any other value: assigned to another variable or property, inserted into an array, passed to or returned from a function, etc. A VarRef can be used to assign to the original target variable or retrieve its value by <a href="Variables.htm#deref">dereferencing</a> it.</p>
<p>For convenience, a function parameter can be declared <a href="Functions.htm#ByRef">ByRef</a> by prefixing the parameter name with ampersand (&amp;). This requires the caller to pass a VarRef, and allows the function itself to "dereference" the VarRef by just referring to the parameter (without percent signs).</p>
<pre>class VarRef extends Any</pre>
<p>The VarRef class currently has no predefined methods or properties, but <code>value is VarRef</code> can be used to test if a value is a VarRef.</p>
<p>When a VarRef is used as a parameter of a COM method, the object itself is not passed. Instead, its value is copied into a temporary VARIANT, which is passed using the <a href="lib/ComObjType.htm#vt">variant type</a> <code>VT_BYREF|VT_VARIANT</code>. When the method returns, the new value is assigned to the VarRef.</p>

<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>
<p>Although a variable is typically thought of as holding a single value, and that value having a distinct type (string, number or object), AutoHotkey automatically converts between numbers and strings in cases like <code>"Value is " myNumber</code> and <code>MsgBox myNumber</code>. As these conversions can happen very frequently, whenever a variable containing a number is converted to a string, the result is <em>cached</em> in the variable.</p>
<p>Currently, AutoHotkey v2 caches a pure number only when assigning a pure number to a variable, not when reading it. This preserves the ability to differentiate between strings and pure numbers (such as with the <a href="lib/Type.htm">Type</a> function, or when passing values to COM objects).</p>

<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>A <em>function</em> is the basic means by which a script <em>does something</em>.</p>
<p>Functions can have many different purposes. Some functions might do no more than perform a simple calculation, while others have immediately visible effects, such as moving a window. One of AutoHotkey's strengths is the ease with which scripts can automate other programs and perform many other common tasks by simply calling a few functions. See the <a href="lib/index.htm">function list</a> for examples.</p>
<p>Throughout this documentation, some common words are used in ways that might not be obvious to someone without prior experience. Below are several such words/phrases which are used frequently in relation to functions:</p>
<dl>
  <dt id="call">Call a function</dt>
  <dd><p><em>Calling</em> a function causes the program to invoke, execute or evaluate it. In other words, a <em>function call</em> temporarily transfers control from the script to the function. When the function has completed its purpose, it <em>returns</em> control to the script. In other words, any code following the function call does not execute until after the function completes.</p>
  <p>However, sometimes a function completes before its effects can be seen by the user. For example, the <a href="lib/Send.htm">Send</a> function <em>sends</em> keystrokes, but may return before the keystrokes reach their destination and cause their intended effect.</p></dd>
  <dt id="parameters">Parameters</dt>
  <dd><p>Usually a function accepts <em>parameters</em> which tell it how to operate or what to operate on. Each parameter is a <a href="#values">value</a>, such as a string or number. For example, <a href="lib/WinMove.htm">WinMove</a> moves a window, so its parameters tell it which window to move and where to move it to. Parameters can also be called <em>arguments</em>. Common abbreviations include <em>param</em> and <em>arg</em>.</p></dd>
  <dt id="pass-parameters">Pass parameters</dt>
  <dd><p>Parameters are <em>passed</em> to a function, meaning that a value is specified for each parameter of the function when it is called. For example, one can <em>pass</em> the name of a key to <a href="lib/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a> to determine whether that key is being held down.</p></dd>
  <dt id="return-a-value">Return a value</dt>
  <dd><p>Functions <em>return</em> a value, so the result of the function is often called a <em>return value</em>. For example, <a href="lib/StrLen.htm">StrLen</a> returns the number of characters in a string. Functions may also store results in variables, such as when there is more than one result (see <a href="Functions.htm#return">Returning Values</a>).</p></dd>
  <dt id="command">Command</dt>
  <dd><p>A function call is sometimes called a <em>command</em>, such as if it <em>commands</em> the program to take a specific action. (For historical reasons, <em>command</em> may refer to a particular style of calling a function, where the parentheses are omitted and the return value is discarded. However, this is technically a <a href="Language.htm#function-call-statements">function call statement</a>.)</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Functions usually expect parameters to be written in a specific order, so the meaning of each parameter value depends on its position in the comma-delimited list of parameters. Some parameters can be omitted, in which case the parameter can be left blank, but the comma following it can only be omitted if all remaining parameters are also omitted. For example, the syntax for <a href="lib/ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a> is:</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">ControlSend</span> Keys <span class="optional">, Control, WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</span>
</pre>
<p>Square brackets signify that the enclosed parameters are optional (the brackets themselves should not appear in the actual code). However, usually one must also specify the target window. For example:</p>
<pre>
ControlSend "^{Home}", "Edit1", "A"  <em>; Correct. Control is specified.</em>
ControlSend "^{Home}", "A"           <em>; Incorrect: Parameters are mismatched.</em>
ControlSend "^{Home}",, "A"          <em>; Correct. Control is omitted.</em>
</pre>

<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>A <em>method</em> is a function associated with a specific <a href="#objects">object</a> or type of object. To call a method, one must specify an object and a method name. The method name does not uniquely identify the function; instead, what happens when the method call is attempted depends on the object. For example, <code>x.Show()</code> might <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Show">show a menu</a>, <a href="lib/Gui.htm#Show">show a GUI</a>, raise an error or do something else, depending on what <code>x</code> is. In other words, a method call simply passes a message to the object, instructing it to do something. For details, see <a href="#object-protocol">Object Protocol</a> and <a href="Language.htm#operators-for-objects">Operators for Objects</a>.</p>

<h2 id="control-flow">Control Flow</h2>
<p><em>Control flow</em> is the order in which individual statements are executed. Normally statements are executed sequentially from top to bottom, but a control flow statement can override this, such as by specifying that statements should be executed repeatedly, or only if a certain condition is met.</p>
<dl>
  <dt id="statement">Statement</dt>
  <dd><p>A <em>statement</em> is simply the smallest standalone element of the language that expresses some action to be carried out. In AutoHotkey, statements include assignments, function calls and other expressions. However, directives, double-colon hotkey and hotstring tags, and declarations without assignments are not statements; they are processed when the program first starts up, before the script <em>executes</em>.</p></dd>
  <dt id="execute">Execute</dt>
  <dd><p>Carry out, perform, evaluate, put into effect, etc. <em>Execute</em> basically has the same meaning as in non-programming speak.</p></dd>
  <dt id="cf-body">Body</dt>
  <dd><p>The <em>body</em> of a control flow statement is the statement or group of statements to which it applies. For example, the body of an <a href="lib/If.htm">if statement</a> is executed only if a specific condition is met.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>For example, consider this simple set of instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Notepad</li>
  <li>Wait for Notepad to appear on the screen</li>
  <li>Type "Hello, world!"</li>
</ol>
<p>We take one step at a time, and when that step is finished, we move on to the next step. In the same way, control in a program or script usually flows from one statement to the next statement. But what if we want to type into an existing Notepad window? Consider this revised set of instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If Notepad is not running:
<ol>
  <li>Open Notepad</li>
  <li>Wait for Notepad to appear on the screen</li>
</ol>
</li>
  <li>Otherwise:
<ol>
  <li>Activate Notepad</li>
</ol>
</li>
  <li>Type "Hello, world!"</li>
</ol>
<p>So we either open Notepad or activate Notepad depending on whether it is already running. #1 is a <em>conditional statement</em>, also known as an <em>if statement</em>; that is, we execute its <em>body</em> (#1.1 - #1.2) only if a condition is met. #2 is an <em>else statement</em>; we execute its body (#2.1) only if the condition of a previous <em>if statement</em> (#1) is not met. Depending on the condition, control <em>flows</em> one of two ways: #1 (if true) &rarr; #1.1 &rarr; #1.2 &rarr; #3; or #1 (if false) &rarr; #2 (else) &rarr; #2.1 &rarr; #3.</p>
<p>The instructions above can be translated into the code below:</p>
<pre>if (not WinExist("ahk_class Notepad"))
{
    Run "Notepad"
    WinWait "ahk_class Notepad"
}
else
    WinActivate "ahk_class Notepad"
Send "Hello, world{!}"
</pre>
<p>In our written instructions, we used indentation and numbering to group the statements. Scripts work a little differently. Although indentation makes code easier to read, in AutoHotkey it does not affect the grouping of statements. Instead, statements are grouped by enclosing them in braces, as shown above. This is called a <a href="lib/Block.htm"><em>block</em></a>.</p>
<p class="note">For details about syntax - that is, how to write or recognise control flow statements in AutoHotkey - see <a href="Language.htm#control-flow">Control Flow</a>.</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<h3 id="string-encoding">String Encoding</h3>
<p>Each character in the string is represented by a number, called its <em>ordinal number</em>, or <em>character code</em>. For example, the value "Abc" would be represented as follows:</p>
<table class="info" style="width: 8em; text-align: center">
  <tr><td>A</td><td>b</td><td>c</td></tr>
  <tr><td>65</td><td>98</td><td>99</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Encoding:</strong> The <em>encoding</em> of a string defines how symbols are mapped to ordinal numbers, and ordinal numbers to bytes. There are many different encodings, but as all of those supported by AutoHotkey include ASCII as a subset, character codes 0 to 127 always have the same meaning. For example, 'A' always has the character code 65.</p>
<p id="null-termination"><strong>Null-termination:</strong> Each string is terminated with a "null character", or in other words, a character with ordinal value of zero marks the end of the string. The length of the string can be inferred by the position of the null-terminator, but AutoHotkey also stores the length, for performance and to permit null characters within the string's length.</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Due to reliance on null-termination, many built-in functions and most expression operators do not support strings with embedded null characters, and instead read only up to the first null character. However, basic manipulation of such strings is supported; e.g. concatenation, <code>==</code>, <code>!==</code>, <code>Chr(0)</code>, <a href="lib/StrLen.htm">StrLen</a>, <a href="lib/SubStr.htm">SubStr</a>, assignments, parameter values and <a href="lib/Return.htm">return</a>.</p>
<p id="native-encoding"><strong>Native encoding:</strong> Although AutoHotkey provides ways to work with text in various encodings, the built-in functions--and to some degree the language itself--all assume string values to be in one particular encoding. This is referred to as the <em>native</em> encoding. The native encoding depends on the version of AutoHotkey:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>Unicode versions of AutoHotkey use UTF-16. The smallest element in a UTF-16 string is two bytes (16 bits). Unicode characters in the range 0 to 65535 (U+FFFF) are represented by a single 16-bit code unit of the same value, while characters in the range 65536 (U+10000) to 1114111 (U+10FFFF) are represented by a <em>surrogate pair</em>; that is, exactly two 16-bit code units between 0xD800 and 0xDFFF. (For further explanation of surrogate pairs and methods of encoding or decoding them, search the Internet.)</p>
</li>
  <li>
<p>ANSI versions of AutoHotkey use the system default ANSI code page, which depends on the system locale or "language for non-Unicode programs" system setting. The smallest element of an ANSI string is one byte. However, some code pages contain characters which are represented by sequences of multiple bytes (these are always non-ASCII characters).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> AutoHotkey v2 natively uses Unicode and does not have an ANSI version.</p>
<p id="character"><strong>Character:</strong> Generally, other parts of this documentation use the term "character" to mean a string's smallest unit; bytes for ANSI strings and 16-bit code units for Unicode (UTF-16) strings. For practical reasons, the length of a string and positions within a string are measured by counting these fixed-size units, even though they may not be complete Unicode characters.</p>
<p><a href="lib/FileRead.htm">FileRead</a>, <a href="lib/FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a>, <a href="lib/FileOpen.htm">FileOpen</a> and the <a href="lib/File.htm">File object</a> provide ways of reading and writing text in files with a specific encoding.</p>
<p>The functions <a href="lib/StrGet.htm">StrGet</a> and <a href="lib/StrPut.htm">StrPut</a> can be used to convert strings between the native encoding and some other specified encoding. However, these are usually only useful in combination with data structures and the <a href="lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> function. Strings which are passed directly to or from <a href="lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> can be converted to ANSI or UTF-16 by using the <code>AStr</code> or <code>WStr</code> parameter types.</p>
<p>Techniques for dealing with the differences between ANSI and Unicode versions of AutoHotkey can be found under <a href="Compat.htm#Format">Unicode vs ANSI</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pure-numbers">Pure Numbers</h3>
<p>A <em>pure</em> or <em>binary</em> number is one which is stored in memory in a format that the computer's CPU can directly work with, such as to perform math. In most cases, AutoHotkey automatically converts between numeric strings and pure numbers as needed, and rarely differentiates between the two types. AutoHotkey primarily uses two data types for pure numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>64-bit signed integers (<em>int64</em>).</li>
  <li>64-bit binary floating-point numbers (the <em>double</em> or <em>binary64</em> format of the IEEE 754 international standard).</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, scripts are affected by the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>Integers must be within the signed 64-bit range; that is, -9223372036854775808 (-0x8000000000000000, or -2<sup>63</sup>) to 9223372036854775807 (0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, or 2<sup>63</sup>-1). If an integer constant in an expression is outside this range, only the low 64 bits are used (the value is truncated). Although larger values can be contained within a string, any attempt to convert the string to a number (such as by using it in a math operation) will cause it to be similarly truncated.</p>
</li>
  <li>
<p>Floating-point numbers generally support 15 digits of precision.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="float-imprecision"><strong>Note:</strong> There are some decimal fractions which the binary floating-point format cannot precisely represent, so a number is rounded to the closest representable number. This may lead to unexpected results. For example:</p>
<pre>
MsgBox 0.1 + 0           <em>; 0.10000000000000001</em>
MsgBox 0.1 + 0.2         <em>; 0.30000000000000004</em>
MsgBox 0.3 + 0           <em>; 0.29999999999999999</em>
MsgBox 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3   <em>; 0 (not equal)</em>
</pre>
<p>One strategy for dealing with this is to avoid direct comparison, instead comparing the difference. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox Abs((0.1 + 0.2) - (0.3)) &lt; 0.0000000000000001
</pre>
<p>Another strategy is to explicitly apply rounding before comparison, such as by converting to a string. There are generally two ways to do this while specifying the precision, and both are shown below:</p>
<pre>MsgBox Round(0.1 + 0.2, 15) = Format("{:.15f}", 0.3)
</pre>

<h3 id="names">Names</h3>
<p>AutoHotkey uses the same set of rules for naming various things, including variables, functions, <a href="lib/GroupAdd.htm">window groups</a>, classes, properties and methods. The rules are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Case sensitivity:</strong> None for ASCII characters. For example, <code>CurrentDate</code> is the same as <code>currentdate</code>. However, uppercase non-ASCII characters such as 'Ä' are <em>not</em> considered equal to their lowercase counterparts, regardless of the current user's locale. This helps the script to behave consistently across multiple locales.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum length:</strong> 253 characters.</p>
<p><strong>Allowed characters:</strong> Letters, digits, underscore and non-ASCII characters; however, the first character cannot be a digit.</p>
<p id="reserved-words"><strong>Reserved words:</strong> <code>as</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>contains</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>is</code>, <code>IsSet</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>super</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>unset</code>. These words are reserved for future use or other specific purposes.</p>
<p>Declaration keywords and names of control flow statements are also reserved, primarily to detect mistakes. This includes: <code>Break</code>, <code>Catch</code>, <code>Continue</code>, <code>Else</code>, <code>Finally</code>, <code>For</code>, <code>Global</code>, <code>Goto</code>, <code>If</code>, <code>Local</code>, <code>Loop</code>, <code>Return</code>, <code>Static</code>, <code>Throw</code>, <code>Try</code>, <code>Until</code>, <code>While</code></p>
<p>Names of properties, methods and window groups are permitted to be reserved words.</p>

<h3 id="references-to-objects">References to Objects</h3>
<p>Scripts interact with an object only indirectly, through a <em>reference</em> to the object. When you create an object, the object is created at some location you don't control, and you're given a reference. Passing this reference to a function or storing it in a variable or another object creates a new reference to the <em>same</em> object.</p>
<p>For example, if <em>myObj</em> contains a reference to an object, <code>yourObj := myObj</code> creates a new reference to the same object. A change such as <code>myObj.ans := 42</code> would be reflected by both <code>myObj.ans</code> and <code>yourObj.ans</code>, since they both refer to the same object. However, <code>myObj := Object()</code> only affects the variable <em>myObj</em>, not the variable <em>yourObj</em>, which still refers to the original object.</p>
<p>A reference is released by simply using an assignment to replace it with any other value. An object is deleted only after all references have been released; you cannot delete an object explicitly, and should not try. (However, you can delete an object's properties, content or associated resources, such as an <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a>'s elements, the window associated with a <a href="lib/Gui.htm">Gui</a>, the menu of a <a href="lib/Menu.htm">Menu</a> object, and so on.)</p>
<pre>ref1 := Object()  <em>; Create an object and store first reference</em>
ref2 := ref1      <em>; Create a new reference to the same object</em>
ref1 := ""        <em>; Release the first reference</em>
ref2 := ""        <em>; Release the second reference; object is deleted</em>
</pre>
<p>If that's difficult to understand, try thinking of an object as a rental unit. When you rent a unit, you're given a key which you can use to access the unit. You can get more keys and use them to access the same unit, but when you're finished with the unit, you must hand all keys back to the rental agent. Usually a unit wouldn't be <em>deleted</em>, but maybe the agent will have any junk you left behind removed; just as any values you stored in an object are freed when the object is deleted.</p>

<h2 id="general-troubleshooting">General Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="install">What can I do if AutoHotkey won't install?</h3>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This answer applies only to the AutoHotkey v1 installer. The v2 installer works differently and has not been finalized.</p>
<p id="install-7z"><strong>7-zip Error:</strong> Use 7-zip or a compatible program to extract the setup files from the installer EXE, then run setup.exe or Installer.ahk (drag and drop Installer.ahk onto AutoHotkeyU32.exe).</p>
<p>AutoHotkey's installer comes packaged as a 7-zip self-extracting archive which attempts to extract to the user's Temp directory and execute a compiled script. Sometimes system policies or other factors prevent the files from being extracted or executed. Usually in such cases the message "7-zip Error" is displayed. Manually extracting the files to a different directory may help.</p>
<p id="install-hang"><strong>Setup hangs:</strong> If the setup window comes up blank or not at all, try one or both of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> when the installer starts. If you get a UAC prompt, hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> as you click Yes/Continue. You should get a prompt asking whether you want to install with default options.</li>
<li>Install using <a href="Program.htm#install">command line options</a>. If you have manually extracted the setup files from the installer EXE, use either <code>setup.exe /S</code> or <code>AutoHotkeyU32.exe Installer.ahk /S</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other:</strong> The suggestions above cover the most common problems. For further assistance, post on the forums.</p>

<h3 id="rightclick">How do I restore the right-click context menu options for .ahk files?</h3>
<p>Normally if AutoHotkey is installed, right-clicking an AutoHotkey script (.ahk) file should give the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run script</li>
  <li>Compile script (if Ahk2Exe is installed)</li>
  <li>Edit script</li>
  <li>Run as administrator</li>
  <li>Run with UI access (if the <a href="Program.htm#Installer_uiAccess">prerequisites</a> are met)</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> On Windows 11, some of these options are usually relegated to a submenu that can be accessed by selecting "Show more options".</p>
<p>Sometimes these options are overridden by settings in the current user's profile, such as if <em>Open With</em> has been used to change the default program for opening .ahk files. This can be fixed by deleting the following registry key:</p>
<pre class="no-highlight">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.ahk\UserChoice</pre>
<p>This can be done by applying <a href="misc/remove-userchoice.reg" download="remove-userchoice.reg">this registry patch</a> or by running <code>UX\reset-assoc.ahk</code> from the AutoHotkey installation directory.</p>
<p>It may also be necessary to repair the default registry values, either by reinstalling AutoHotkey or by running <code>UX\install.ahk</code> from the AutoHotkey installation directory.</p>

<h3 id="vista">Why doesn't my script work on Windows <em>xxx</em> even though it worked on a previous version?</h3>
<p>There are many variations of this problem, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I've upgraded my computer/Windows and now my script won't work.</li>
  <li>Hotkeys/hotstrings don't work when a program running as admin is active.</li>
  <li>Some windows refuse to be automated (e.g. Device Manager ignores Send).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've switched operating systems, it is likely that something else has also changed and may be affecting your script. For instance, if you've got a new computer, it might have different drivers or other software installed. If you've also updated to a newer version of AutoHotkey, find out which version you had before and then check the <a href="ChangeLog.htm">changelog</a> and <a href="Compat.htm">compatibility notes</a>.</p>
<p>Also refer to the following question:</p>

<h3 id="uac">How do I work around problems caused by User Account Control (UAC)?</h3>
<p>By default, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control">User Account Control (UAC)</a> protects "elevated" programs (that is, programs which are running as admin) from being automated by non-elevated programs, since that would allow them to bypass security restrictions. Hotkeys are also blocked, so for instance, a non-elevated program cannot spy on input intended for an elevated program.</p>
<p>UAC may also prevent <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a> and <a href="lib/BlockInput.htm">BlockInput</a> from working.</p>
<p>Common workarounds are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Recommended:</strong> <a href="Program.htm#Installer_uiAccess">Run with UI access</a>. This requires AutoHotkey to be installed under Program Files. There are several ways to do this, including:
  <ul>
    <li>Right-click the script in Explorer and select <em>Run with UI access</em>.</li>
    <li>Use the <em>UIAccess</em> shell verb with Run, as in <code>Run '*UIAccess "Your script.ahk"'</code>.</li>
    <li>Use a <a href="Scripts.htm#cmd">command line</a> such as <code>"AutoHotkey32_UIA.exe" "Your script.ahk"</code> (but include full paths where necessary).</li>
    <li>Set scripts to run with UI access by default, by checking the appropriate box in the <a href="Program.htm#launcher-config">Launch Settings</a> GUI.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Run the script <a href="Variables.htm#IsAdmin">as administrator</a>. Note that this also causes any programs launched by the script to run as administrator, and may require the user to accept an approval prompt when launching the script.</li>
  <li>Disable the local security policy "Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode" (not recommended).</li>
  <li>Disable UAC completely. This is not recommended, and is not feasible on Windows 8 or later.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="DefaultScript">I can't edit my script via tray icon because it won't start due to an error. What should I do?</h3>
<p>You need to fix the error in your script before you can get your tray icon back. But first, you need to find the script file.</p>
<p>Look for AutoHotkey.ahk in the following directories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your <em>Documents</em> (or <em>My Documents</em>) folder.</li>
  <li>The directory where you installed AutoHotkey, usually C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey. If you are using AutoHotkey without having installed it, look in the directory which contains AutoHotkey.exe.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running another AutoHotkey executable directly, the name of the script depends on the executable. For example, if you are running AutoHotkey32.exe, look for AutoHotkey32.ahk. Note that depending on your system settings the ".ahk" part may be hidden, but the file should have an icon like <img src="static/ahkfile16.png" alt="[H]"></p>
<p>You can usually edit a script file by right clicking it and selecting <em>Edit Script</em>. If that doesn't work, you can open the file in Notepad or another editor.</p>
<p>If you launch AutoHotkey from the Start menu or by running AutoHotkey.exe directly (without command line parameters), it will look for a script in one of the locations shown above. Alternatively, you can create a script file (something.ahk) anywhere you like, and run the script file instead of running AutoHotkey.</p>

<h3 id="Debug">How can I find and fix errors in my code?</h3>
<p>For simple scripts, see <a href="Scripts.htm#debug">Debugging a Script</a>. To show contents of a variable, use <a href="lib/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a> or <a href="lib/ToolTip.htm">ToolTip</a>. For complex scripts, see <a href="Scripts.htm#idebug">Interactive Debugging</a>.</p>
<h3 id="run">Why is the <a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> function unable to launch my game or program?</h3>
<p>Some programs need to be started in their own directories (when in doubt, it is usually best to do so). For example:</p>
<pre>Run A_ProgramFiles "\Some Application\App.exe", A_ProgramFiles "\Some Application"</pre>
<p>If the program you are trying to start is in <code>A_WinDir "\System32"</code> and you are using AutoHotkey 32-bit on a 64-bit system, the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winprog64/file-system-redirector">File System Redirector</a> may be interfering. To work around this, use <code>A_WinDir "\SysNative"</code> instead; this is a virtual directory only visible to 32-bit programs running on 64-bit systems.</p>

<h3 id="nonascii">Why are the non-ASCII characters in my script displaying or sending incorrectly?</h3>
<p>Short answer: Save the script as UTF-8.</p>
<p>Non-ASCII characters are represented by different binary values depending on the chosen encoding. In order for such characters to be interpreted correctly, your text editor and AutoHotkey must be <em>on the same codepage</em>, so to speak. AutoHotkey v2 defaults to UTF-8 for all script files, although this can be overridden with the <a href="Scripts.htm#cp">/CP command line switch</a>.</p>
<p>To save as UTF-8 in Notepad, select <em>UTF-8</em> or <em>UTF-8 with BOM</em> from the <em>Encoding</em> drop-down in the Save As dialog. Note that Notepad in Windows 10 version 1903 and later defaults to UTF-8.</p>
<p>To read other UTF-8 files which lack a byte order mark, use <code><a href="lib/FileEncoding.htm">FileEncoding</a> "UTF-8-RAW"</code>, the <code>*P65001</code> option with <a href="lib/FileRead.htm">FileRead</a>, or <code>"UTF-8-RAW"</code> for the third parameter of <a href="lib/FileOpen.htm">FileOpen</a>. The <code>-RAW</code> suffix can be omitted, but in that case any newly created files will have a byte order mark.</p>
<p>Note that INI files accessed with the standard INI functions do not support UTF-8; they must be saved as ANSI or UTF-16.</p>

<h3 id="games">Why don't <a href="Hotstrings.htm">Hotstrings</a>, <a href="lib/Send.htm">Send</a>, and <a href="lib/Click.htm">Click</a> work in certain games?</h3>
<p>Not all games allow AHK to send keys and clicks or receive pixel colors.</p>
<p>But there are some alternatives, try all the solutions mentioned below. If all these fail, it may not be possible for AHK to work with your game. Sometimes games have a hack and cheat prevention measure, such as GameGuard and Hackshield. If they do, there is a high chance that AutoHotkey will not work with that game.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Use SendPlay via the <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendPlay">SendPlay</a> function, <a href="lib/SendMode.htm">SendMode Play</a> and/or the <a href="Hotstrings.htm">hotstring option SP</a>.</p>
  <pre>SendPlay "abc"</pre>
  <pre>SendMode "Play"

  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: SendPlay may have no effect at all if User Account Control is enabled, even if the script is running as an administrator.</p>

  <li>
  <p>Increase <a href="lib/SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a>. For example:</p>
  <pre>SetKeyDelay 0, 50
SetKeyDelay 0, 50, "Play"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Try <a href="lib/ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a>, which might work in cases where the other Send modes fail:</p>
  <pre>ControlSend "abc",, <i>GameTitle</i></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Try the down and up event of a key with the various send methods:</p>
  <pre>Send "{<i>KEY</i> Down}{<i>KEY</i> Up}"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Try the down and up event of a key with a <a href="lib/ControlSend.htm">Sleep</a> between them:</p>
  <pre>Send "{<i>KEY</i> down}"

<h3 id="perf">How can performance be improved for games or at other times when the CPU is under heavy load?</h3>
<p>If a script's <a href="Hotkeys.htm">Hotkeys</a>, <a href="lib/Click.htm">Clicks</a>, or <a href="lib/Send.htm">Sends</a> are noticeably slower than normal while the CPU is under heavy load, raising the script's process-priority may help. To do this, include the following line near the top of the script:</p>
<pre><a href="lib/ProcessSetPriority.htm">ProcessSetPriority</a> "High"</pre>
<h3 id="Virus">My antivirus program flagged AutoHotkey or a compiled script as malware. Is it really a virus?</h3>
<p>Although it is certainly possible that the file has been infected, most often these alerts are <em>false positives</em>, meaning that the antivirus program is mistaken. One common suggestion is to upload the file to an online service such as <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">virustotal</a> or <a href="https://virusscan.jotti.org/">Jotti</a> and see what other antivirus programs have to say. If in doubt, you could send the file to the vendor of your antivirus software for confirmation. This might also help us and other AutoHotkey users, as the vendor may confirm it is a false positive and fix their product to play nice with AutoHotkey.</p>
<p>False positives might be more common for compiled scripts which have been compressed, such as with UPX (default for AutoHotkey 1.0 but not 1.1) or MPRESS (optional for AutoHotkey 1.1). As the default AutoHotkey installation does not include a compressor, compiled scripts are not compressed by default.</p>

<h2 id="common-tasks">Common Tasks</h2>

<h3 id="Download">Where can I find the official build, or older releases?</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/download/">download page of AutoHotkey</a>.</p>
<h3 id="USB">Can I run AHK from a USB drive?</h3>
<p>See <a href="Program.htm#portability">Portability of AutoHotkey.exe</a>.</p>
<h3 id="output">How can the output of a command line operation be retrieved?</h3>
<p>Testing shows that due to file caching, a temporary file can be very fast for relatively small outputs. In fact, if the file is deleted immediately after use, it often does not actually get written to disk. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="lib/Run.htm">RunWait</a> A_ComSpec ' /c dir &gt; C:\My Temp File.txt'
VarToContainContents := FileRead("C:\My Temp File.txt")
FileDelete "C:\My Temp File.txt"</pre>
<p>To avoid using a temporary file (especially if the output is large), consider using the <a href="lib/Run.htm#ExStdOut">Shell.Exec()</a> method as shown in the examples for the <a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> function.</p>
<h3 id="close">How can a script close, pause, suspend or reload other script(s)?</h3>
<p>First, here is an example that closes another script:</p>
<pre>DetectHiddenWindows True  <em>; Allows a script's hidden main window to be detected.</em>
SetTitleMatchMode 2  <em>; Avoids the need to specify the full path of the file below.</em>
WinClose "ScriptFileName.ahk - AutoHotkey"  <em>; Update this to reflect the script's name (case sensitive).</em></pre>
<p>To <a href="lib/Suspend.htm">suspend</a>, <a href="lib/Pause.htm">pause</a> or <a href="lib/Reload.htm">reload</a> another script, replace the last line above with one of these:</p>
<pre>PostMessage 0x0111, 65305,,, "ScriptFileName.ahk - AutoHotkey"  <em>; Suspend.</em>
PostMessage 0x0111, 65306,,, "ScriptFileName.ahk - AutoHotkey"  <em>; Pause.</em>
PostMessage 0x0111, 65303,,, "ScriptFileName.ahk - AutoHotkey"  <em>; Reload.</em></pre>
<h3 id="repeat">How can a repeating action be stopped without exiting the script?</h3>
<p>To pause or resume the entire script at the press of a key, assign a hotkey to the <a href="lib/Pause.htm">Pause</a> function as in this example:</p>
<pre>^!p::Pause  <em>; Press Ctrl+Alt+P to pause. Press it again to resume.</em></pre>
<p>To stop an action that is repeating inside a <a href="lib/Loop.htm">Loop</a>, consider the following working example, which is a hotkey that both starts and stops its own repeating action. In other words, pressing the hotkey once will start the Loop. Pressing the same hotkey again will stop it.</p>
<pre>#MaxThreadsPerHotkey 3
#z::  <em><strong>; Win+Z hotkey (change this hotkey to suit your preferences).</strong></em>
{
    static KeepWinZRunning := false
    if KeepWinZRunning  <em>; This means an underlying <a href="misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> is already running the loop below.</em>
    {
        KeepWinZRunning := false  <em>; Signal that thread's loop to stop.</em>
        return  <em>; End this thread so that the one underneath will resume and see the change made by the line above.</em>
    }
    <em>; Otherwise:</em>
    KeepWinZRunning := true
    Loop
    {
        <strong><em>; The next four lines are the action you want to repeat (update them to suit your preferences):</em></strong>
        ToolTip "Press Win-Z again to stop this from flashing."
        Sleep 1000
        ToolTip
        Sleep 1000
        <strong><em>; But leave the rest below unchanged.</em></strong>
        if not KeepWinZRunning  <em>; The user signaled the loop to stop by pressing Win-Z again.</em>
            break  <em>; Break out of this loop.</em>
    }
    KeepWinZRunning := false  <em>; Reset in preparation for the next press of this hotkey.</em>
}

<h3 id="help">How can context sensitive help for AutoHotkey functions be used in any editor?</h3>
<p>Rajat created <a href="scripts/index.htm#ContextSensitiveHelp">this script</a>.</p>
<h3 id="load">How to detect when a web page is finished loading?</h3>
<p>With Internet Explorer, perhaps the most reliable method is to use DllCall and COM as demonstrated at <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic19256.html">www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic19256.html</a>. On a related note, the contents of the address bar and status bar can be retrieved as demonstrated at <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic19255.html">www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic19255.html</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Older, less reliable method:</strong> The technique in the following example will work with MS Internet Explorer for most pages. A similar technique might work in other browsers:</p>
<pre>Run "www.yahoo.com"
MouseMove 0, 0  <em>; Prevents the status bar from showing a mouse-hover link instead of "Done".</em>
WinWait "Yahoo! - "
WinActivate
if StatusBarWait("Done", 30)
    MsgBox "The page is done loading."
else
    MsgBox "The wait timed out or the window was closed."
</pre>
<h3 id="time">How can dates and times be compared or manipulated?</h3>
<p>The <a href="lib/DateAdd.htm">DateAdd</a> function can add or subtract a quantity of days, hours, minutes, or seconds to a time-string that is in the <a href="lib/FileSetTime.htm#YYYYMMDD">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a> format. The following example subtracts 7 days from the specified time:</p>
<pre>Result := DateAdd(VarContainingTimestamp, -7, "days")</pre>
<p>To determine the amount of time between two dates or times, see <a href="lib/DateDiff.htm">DateDiff</a>, which gives an example. Also, the built-in variable <a href="Variables.htm#Now">A_Now</a> contains the current local time. Finally, there are several built-in <a href="Variables.htm#date">date/time variables</a>, as well as the <a href="lib/FormatTime.htm">FormatTime</a> function to create a custom date/time string.</p>
<h3 id="SendDate">How can I send the current Date and/or Time?</h3>

<h3 id="Startup">How do I put my hotkeys and hotstrings into effect automatically every time I start my PC?</h3>
<p>There are several ways to make a script (or any program) launch automatically every time you start your PC. The easiest is to place a shortcut to the script in the Startup folder:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find the script file, select it, and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Press <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to open the Run dialog, then enter <code>shell:startup</code> and click OK or <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This will open the Startup folder for the current user. To instead open the folder for all users, enter <code>shell:common startup</code> (however, in that case you must be an administrator to proceed).</li>
  <li>Right click inside the window, and click "Paste Shortcut". The shortcut to the script should now be in the Startup folder.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="HotMouse">I'm having trouble getting my mouse buttons working as hotkeys. Any advice?</h3>
<p>The left and right mouse buttons should be assignable normally (for example, <code>#LButton::</code> is the <kbd>Win</kbd>+LeftButton hotkey). Similarly, the middle button and the turning of the <a href="KeyList.htm">mouse wheel</a> should be assignable normally except on mice whose drivers directly control those buttons.</p>
<p> The fourth button (XButton1) and the fifth button (XButton2) might be assignable if your mouse driver allows their clicks to be <a href="lib/KeyHistory.htm">seen</a> by the system. If they cannot be seen -- or if your mouse has more than five buttons that you want to use -- you can try configuring the software that came with the mouse (sometimes accessible in the Control Panel or Start Menu) to send a keystroke whenever you press one of these buttons. Such a keystroke can then be defined as a hotkey in a script. For example, if you configure the fourth button to send <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>, you can then indirectly configure that button as a hotkey by using <code>^F1::</code> in a script.</p>
<p>If you have a five-button mouse whose fourth and fifth buttons cannot be <a href="lib/KeyHistory.htm">seen</a>, you can try changing your mouse driver to the default driver included with the OS. This assumes there is such a driver for your particular mouse and that you can live without the features provided by your mouse's custom software.</p>
<h3 id="HotSymb">How can Tab and Space be defined as hotkeys?</h3>
<p>Use the names of the keys (Tab and Space) rather than their characters. For example, <code>#Space</code> is <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> and <code>^!Tab</code> is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.</p>
<h3 id="Remap">How can keys or mouse buttons be remapped so that they become different keys?</h3>
<p>This is described on the <a href="misc/Remap.htm">remapping</a> page.</p>
<h3 id="DoublePress">How do I detect the double press of a key or button?</h3>
<p>Use <a href="Variables.htm#h">built-in variables for hotkeys</a> as follows:</p>
<pre>~Ctrl::
{
    if (ThisHotkey = A_PriorHotkey &amp;&amp; A_TimeSincePriorHotkey &lt; 200)
        MsgBox "double-press"
}</pre>
<h3 id="HotContext">How can a <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> or <a href="Hotstrings.htm">hotstring</a> be made exclusive to  certain program(s)? In other words, I want a certain key to act as it normally does except when a specific window is active.</h3>
<p>The preferred method is <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActive("ahk_class Notepad")
^a::MsgBox "You pressed Control-A while Notepad is active."
</pre>
<h3 id="HotPrefix">How can  a prefix key be made to perform its native function rather than doing nothing?</h3>
<p>Consider the following example, which makes Numpad0 into a prefix key:</p>
<pre>Numpad0 &amp; Numpad1::MsgBox "You pressed Numpad1 while holding down Numpad0."</pre>
<p>Now, to make Numpad0 send a real Numpad0 keystroke whenever it wasn't used to launch a hotkey such as the above, add the following hotkey:</p>
<pre> $Numpad0::Send "{Numpad0}"</pre>
<p>The $ prefix is needed to prevent a warning dialog about an infinite loop (since the hotkey "sends itself"). In addition, the above action occurs at the time the key is <strong>released.</strong></p>
<h3 id="HotOverride">How can the built-in Windows shortcut keys, such as Win+U (Utility Manager) and Win+R (Run), be changed or disabled?</h3>
<p>Here are some <a href="misc/Override.htm">examples</a>.</p>
<h3 id="HotRegex">Can I use wildcards or regular expressions in Hotstrings?</h3>
<p>Use the <a href="https://github.com/polyethene/AutoHotkey-Scripts/blob/master/Hotstrings.ahk">script</a> by polyethene (examples are included).</p>
<h3 id="SpecialKey">How can I use a hotkey that is not in my keyboard layout?</h3>
<p>See <a href="KeyList.htm#SpecialKeys">Special Keys</a>.</p>
<h3 id="HotZero">My keypad has a special 000 key. Is it possible to turn it into a hotkey?</h3>
<p>You can. This  <a href="scripts/index.htm#Numpad000">example script</a> makes <kbd>000</kbd> into an equals key. You can change the action by replacing the <code>Send "="</code> line with line(s) of your choice.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="intro">Introduction and Simple Examples</h2>
<p id="define">A function is a reusable block of code that can be executed by <em>calling</em> it. A function can optionally accept parameters (inputs) and return a value (output). Consider the following simple function that accepts two numbers and returns their sum:</p>
<pre>Add(x, y)
{
    <a href="lib/Return.htm">return</a> x + y
}</pre>
<p>The above is known as a function <em>definition</em> because it creates a function named "Add" (not case sensitive) and establishes that anyone who calls it must provide exactly two parameters (x and y). To call the function, assign its result to a variable with the <a href="Variables.htm#AssignOp"><code>:=</code> operator</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>Var := Add(2, 3)  <em>; The number 5 will be stored in Var.</em></pre>
<p>Also, a function may be called without storing its return value:</p>
<pre>Add(2, 3)
Add 2, 3  <em>; Parentheses can be omitted if used at the start of a line.</em></pre>
<p>But in this case, any value returned by the function is discarded; so unless the function produces some effect other than its return value, the call would serve no purpose.</p>
<p>Within an expression, a function call "evaluates to" the return value of the function. The return value can be assigned to a variable as shown above, or it can be used directly as shown below:</p>
<pre>if <a href="lib/InStr.htm">InStr</a>(MyVar, "fox")
    MsgBox "The variable MyVar contains the word fox."</pre>

<h2 id="param">Parameters</h2>
<p>When a function is defined, its parameters are listed in parentheses next to its name (there must be no spaces between its name and the open-parenthesis). If a function does not accept any parameters, leave the parentheses empty; for example: <code>GetCurrentTimestamp()</code>.</p>
<p id="ByRef"><strong>ByRef Parameters</strong>: From the function's point of view, parameters are essentially the same as <a href="#Local">local variables</a> unless they are marked as <em>ByRef</em> as in this example:</p>
<pre>a := 1, b := 2
Swap(&amp;a, &amp;b)
MsgBox a ',' b

Swap(&amp;Left, &amp;Right)
{
    temp := Left
    Left := Right
    Right := temp
}</pre>
<p>In the example above, the use of <code>&amp;</code> requires the caller to pass a <a href="Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a>, which usually corresponds to one of the caller's variables. Each parameter becomes an alias for the variable represented by the VarRef. In other words, the parameter and the caller's variable both refer to the same contents in memory. This allows the Swap function to alter the caller's variables by moving <em>Left</em>'s contents into <em>Right</em> and vice versa.</p>
<p>By contrast, if <em>ByRef</em> were not used in the example above, <em>Left</em> and <em>Right</em> would be copies of the caller's variables and thus the Swap function would have no external effect. However, the function could instead be changed to explicitly <a href="Variables.htm#deref">dereference</a> each VarRef. For example:</p>
<pre>Swap(Left, Right)
{
    temp := %Left%
    %Left% := %Right%
    %Right% := temp
}</pre>
<p>Since <a href="lib/Return.htm">return</a> can send back only one value to a function's caller, VarRefs can be used to send back extra results. This is achieved by having the caller pass in a reference to a variable (usually empty) in which the function stores a value.</p>
<p>When passing large strings to a function, <em>ByRef</em> enhances performance and conserves memory by avoiding the need to make a copy of the string. Similarly, using <em>ByRef</em> to send a long string back to the caller usually performs better than something like <code>Return HugeString</code>. However, what the function receives is not a reference to the string, but a reference to the <em>variable</em>. Future improvements might supersede the use of ByRef for these purposes.</p>
<p>Known limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is not possible to construct a VarRef for a property of an object (such as <code>foo.bar</code>), <a href="lib/A_Clipboard.htm">A_Clipboard</a> or any other <a href="Variables.htm#BuiltIn">built-in variable</a>, so those cannot be passed <em>ByRef</em>.</li>
  <li>If a parameter in a function-call resolves to a variable (e.g. <code>Var</code> or <code>++Var</code> or <code>Var*=2</code>), other parameters to its left or right can alter that variable before it is passed to the function. For example, <code>MyFunc(Var, Var++)</code> would unexpectedly pass 1 and 0 when <em>Var</em> is initially 0, because the first <em>Var</em> is not dereferenced until the function call is executed. Since this behavior is counterintuitive, it might change in a future release.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional">Optional Parameters</h2>
<p>When defining a function, one or more of its parameters can be marked as optional.</p>
<p>Append <code>:=</code> followed by a literal number, quoted/literal string such as "fox" or "", or an expression that should be evaluated each time the parameter needs to be initialized with its default value. For example, <code>X:=[]</code> would create a new Array each time.</p>
<p>Append <code>?</code> or <code>:= unset</code> to define a parameter which is <a href="#unset">unset by default</a>.</p>
<p>The following function has its Z parameter marked optional:</p>
<pre>Add(X, Y, Z := 0) {
    return X + Y + Z
}</pre>
<p>When the caller passes <strong>three</strong> parameters to the function above, Z's default value is ignored. But when the caller passes only <strong>two</strong> parameters, Z automatically receives the value 0.</p>
<p id="missing">It is not possible to have optional parameters isolated in the middle of the parameter list. In other words, all parameters that lie to the right of the first optional parameter must also be marked optional. However, optional parameters may be omitted from the middle of the parameter list when calling the function, as shown below:</p>
<pre>MyFunc(1,, 3)
MyFunc(X, Y:=2, Z:=0) {  <em>; Note that Z must still be optional in this case.</em>
    MsgBox X ", " Y ", " Z
}</pre>
<p id="OptionalByRef"><a href="#ByRef">ByRef parameters</a> also support default values; for example: <code>MyFunc(&amp;p1 := "")</code>. Whenever the caller omits such a parameter, the function creates a local variable to contain the default value; in other words, the function behaves as though the symbol "&amp;" is absent.</p>

<h3 id="unset">Unset Parameters</h3>
<p>To mark a parameter as optional without supplying a default value, use the keyword <code>unset</code> or the <code>?</code> suffix. In that case, whenever the parameter is omitted, the corresponding variable will have no value. Use <a href="lib/IsSet.htm">IsSet</a> to determine whether the parameter has been given a value, as shown below:</p>
<pre>
MyFunc(p?) {  <em>; Equivalent to MyFunc(p := unset)</em>
    if IsSet(p)
        MsgBox "Caller passed " p
    else
        MsgBox "Caller did not pass anything"
}

MyFunc(42)
MyFunc
</pre>
<p>Attempting to read the parameter's value when it has none is considered an error, the same as for any <a href="Concepts.htm#uninitialized-variables">uninitialized variable</a>. To pass an optional parameter through to another function even when the parameter has no value, use the <a href="Variables.htm#maybe">maybe operator (<em>var</em><strong>?</strong>)</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>
Greet(title?) {
    MsgBox("Hello!", title?)
}

Greet "Greeting"  <em>; Title is "Greeting"</em>
Greet             <em>; Title is A_ScriptName</em>
</pre>

<h2 id="return">Returning Values to Caller</h2>
<p>As described in <a href="#intro">introduction</a>, a function may optionally <a href="lib/Return.htm">return</a> a value to its caller.</p>
<pre>
MsgBox returnTest()

returnTest() {
    return 123
}
</pre>
<p>If you want to return extra results from a function, you may also use <a href="#ByRef">ByRef (&amp;)</a>:</p>
<pre>
returnByRef(&amp;A,&amp;B,&amp;C)
MsgBox A "," B "," C

returnByRef(&amp;val1, &amp;val2, val3)
{
    val1 := "A"
    val2 := 100
    %val3% := 1.1  <em>; % is used because &amp; was omitted.</em>
    return
}
</pre>
<p>Objects and Arrays can be used to return multiple values or even named values:</p>
<pre>
Test1 := returnArray1()
MsgBox Test1[1] "," Test1[2]

Test2 := returnArray2()
MsgBox Test2[1] "," Test2[2]

Test3 := returnObject()
MsgBox Test3.id "," Test3.val

returnArray1() {
    Test := [123,"ABC"]
    return Test
}

returnArray2() {
    x := 456
    y := "EFG"
    return [x, y]
}

returnObject() {
    Test := {id: 789, val: "HIJ"}
    return Test
}
</pre>
<h2 id="Variadic">Variadic Functions</h2>
<p>When defining a function, write an asterisk after the final parameter to mark the function as variadic, allowing it to receive a variable number of parameters:</p>
<pre>Join(sep, <b class="blue">params*</b>) {
    for index,param in params
        str .= param . sep
    return SubStr(str, 1, -StrLen(sep))
}
MsgBox Join("`n", "one", "two", "three")</pre>
<p>When a variadic function is called, surplus parameters can be accessed via an object which is stored in the function's final parameter. The first surplus parameter is at <code>params[1]</code>, the second at <code>params[2]</code> and so on. As it is an <a href="lib/Array.htm">array</a>, <code>params.<a href="lib/Array.htm#Length">Length</a></code> can be used to determine the number of parameters.</p>
<p>Attempting to call a non-variadic function with more parameters than it accepts is considered an error. To permit a function to accept any number of parameters <em>without</em> creating an array to store the surplus parameters, write <code>*</code> as the final parameter (without a parameter name).</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> The "variadic" parameter can only appear at the end of the formal parameter list.</p>

<h3 id="VariadicCall">Variadic Function Calls</h3>
<p>While variadic functions can <i>accept</i> a variable number of parameters, an array of parameters can be passed to <i>any</i> function by applying the same syntax to a function-call:</p>
<pre>substrings := ["one", "two", "three"]
MsgBox Join("`n", <b class="blue">substrings*</b>)</pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The object can be an <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> or any other kind of enumerable object (any object with an <a href="Objects.htm#__Enum">__Enum</a> method) or an <a href="lib/Enumerator.htm">enumerator</a>. If the object is not an Array, __Enum is called with a count of 1 and the enumerator is called with only one parameter at a time.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> elements with no value (such as the first element in <code>[,2]</code>) are equivalent to omitting the parameter; that is, the parameter's default value is used if it is optional, otherwise an exception is thrown.</li>
  <li>This syntax can also be used when calling methods or setting or retrieving properties of objects; for example, <code>Object.Property[Params*]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Known limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Only the right-most parameter can be expanded this way. For example, <code>MyFunc(x, y*)</code> is supported but <code>MyFunc(x*, y)</code> is not.</li>
  <li>There must not be any non-whitespace characters between the asterisk (<code>*</code>) and the symbol which ends the parameter list.</li>
  <li><a href="Language.htm#function-call-statements">Function call statements</a> cannot be variadic; that is, the parameter list must be enclosed in parentheses (or brackets for a property).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Locals">Local and Global Variables</h2>
<h3 id="Local">Local Variables</h3>
<p>Local variables are specific to a single function and are visible only inside that function. Consequently, a local variable may have the same name as a global variable but have separate contents. Separate functions may also safely use the same variable names.</p>
<p>All local variables which are not <a href="#static">static</a> are automatically freed (made empty) when the function returns, with the exception of variables which are bound to a <a href="#closures">closure</a> or <a href="Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a> (such variables are freed at the same time as the closure or VarRef).</p>
<p>Built-in variables such as <a href="lib/A_Clipboard.htm">A_Clipboard</a> and <a href="Variables.htm#TimeIdle">A_TimeIdle</a> are never local (they can be accessed from anywhere), and cannot be redeclared. (This does not apply to built-in classes such as <a href="lib/Object.htm">Object</a>; they are predefined as <a href="#Global">global</a> variables.)</p>
<p id="AssumeLocal">Functions are <strong>assume-local</strong> by default. Variables accessed or created inside an assume-local function are local by default, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Global">Global</a> variables which are only read by the function, not assigned or used with the <a href="Variables.htm#ref">reference operator (&amp;)</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="#nested">Nested functions</a> may refer to local and static variables created by an enclosing function.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default may also be overridden by declaring the variable using the <code>local</code> keyword, or by changing the mode of the function (as shown below).</p>

<h3 id="Global">Global variables</h3>
<p id="AssignLocal">Any variable reference in an <a href="#AssumeLocal">assume-local</a> function may resolve to a global variable if it is only read. However, if a variable is used in an assignment or with the <a href="Variables.htm#ref">reference operator (&amp;)</a>, it is automatically local by default. This allows functions to read global variables or call global or built-in functions without declaring them inside the function, while protecting the script from unintended side-effects when the name of a local variable being assigned coincides with a global variable. For example:</p>
<pre>LogToFile(TextToLog)
{
    <em>; LogFileName was previously given a value somewhere outside this function.
    ; FileAppend is a predefined global variable containing a built-in function.</em>
    FileAppend TextToLog "`n", LogFileName
}</pre>
<p>Otherwise, to refer to an existing global variable inside a function (or create a new one), declare the variable as global prior to using it. For example:</p>
<pre>SetDataDir(Dir)
{
    <strong>global</strong> LogFileName
    LogFileName := Dir . "\My.log"
    <strong>global</strong> DataDir := Dir  <em>; Declaration combined with assignment, described <a href="#DeclareInit">below</a>.</em>
}
</pre>
<p id="AssumeGlobal"><strong>Assume-global mode</strong>: If a function needs to access or create a large number of global variables, it can be defined to assume that all its variables are global (except its parameters) by making its first line the word "global". For example:</p>
<pre>SetDefaults()
{
    <strong>global</strong>
    MyGlobal := 33  <em>; Assigns 33 to a global variable, first creating the variable if necessary.</em>
    local x, y:=0, z  <em>; Local variables must be declared in this mode, otherwise they would be assumed global.</em>
}</pre>

<h3 id="static">Static variables</h3>
<p>Static variables are always implicitly local, but differ from locals because their values are remembered between calls. For example:</p>
<pre>LogToFile(TextToLog)
{
    <strong>static</strong> LoggedLines := 0
    LoggedLines += 1  <em>; Maintain a tally locally (its value is remembered between calls).</em>
    global LogFileName
    FileAppend LoggedLines ": " TextToLog "`n", LogFileName
}</pre>
<p id="InitStatic">A static variable may be initialized on the same line as its declaration by following it with <code>:=</code> and any <a href="Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>. For example: <code>static X:=0, Y:="fox"</code>. Static declarations are evaluated the same as <a href="#Local">local</a> declarations, except that after a static initializer (or group of combined initializers) is successfully evaluated, it is effectively removed from the flow of control and will not execute a second time.</p>
<p>Nested functions can be <a href="#static-functions">declared static</a> to prevent them from capturing non-static local variables of the outer function.</p>
<p id="AssumeStatic"><strong>Assume-static mode</strong>: A function may be defined to assume that all its undeclared local variables are static (except its parameters) by making its first line the word "static". For example:</p>
<pre>GetFromStaticArray(WhichItemNumber)
{
    <strong>static</strong>
    static FirstCallToUs := true  <em>; Each static declaration's initializer still runs only once.</em>
    if FirstCallToUs  <em>; Create a static array during the first call, but not on subsequent calls.</em>
    {
        FirstCallToUs := false
        StaticArray := []
        Loop 10
            StaticArray.Push("Value #" . A_Index)
    }
    return StaticArray[WhichItemNumber]
}</pre>
<p>In assume-static mode, any variable that should not be static must be declared as local or global (with the same exceptions as for <a href="#AssumeLocal">assume-local mode</a>).</p>

<h3 id="More_about_locals_and_globals">More about locals and globals</h3>
<p>Multiple variables may be declared on the same line by separating them with commas as in these examples:</p>
<pre>global LogFileName, MaxRetries := 5
static TotalAttempts := 0, PrevResult</pre>
<p id="DeclareInit">A variable may be initialized on the same line as its declaration by following it with an assignment. Unlike <a href="#InitStatic">static initializers</a>, the initializers of locals and globals execute every time the function is called. In other words, a line like <code>local x := 0</code> has the same effect as writing two separate lines: <code>local x</code> followed by <code>x := 0</code>. Any <a href="Variables.htm#AssignOp">assignment operator</a> can be used, but a compound assignment such as <code>global HitCount += 1</code> would require that the variable has previously been assigned a value.</p>
<p>Because the words <em>local</em>, <em>global</em>, and <em>static</em> are processed immediately when the script launches, a variable cannot be conditionally declared by means of an <a href="lib/If.htm">IF statement</a>. In other words, a declaration inside an IF's or ELSE's <a href="lib/Block.htm">block</a> takes effect unconditionally for the entire function (but any initializers included in the declaration are still conditional). A dynamic declaration such as <code>global Array%i%</code> is not possible, since all non-dynamic references to variables such as <code>Array1</code> or <code>Array99</code> would have already been resolved to addresses.</p>

<h2 id="DynCall">Dynamically Calling a Function</h2>
<p>Although a function call expression usually begins with a literal function name, the target of the call can be any expression which produces a <a href="misc/Functor.htm">function object</a>. In the expression <code>GetKeyState("Shift")</code>, <em>GetKeyState</em> is actually a variable reference, although it usually refers to a read-only variable containing a built-in function.</p>
<p>A function call is said to be <em>dynamic</em> if the target of the call is determined while the script is running, instead of before the script starts. The same syntax is used as for normal function calls; the only apparent difference is that certain error-checking is performed at load time for non-dynamic calls but only at run time for dynamic calls.</p>
<p>For example, <code>MyFunc()</code> would call the <a href="misc/Functor.htm">function object</a> contained by <em>MyFunc</em>, which could be either the actual name of a function, or just a variable which has been assigned a function.</p>
<p>Other expressions can be used as the target of a function call, including <a href="Variables.htm#deref">double-derefs</a>. For example, <code>MyArray[1]()</code> would call the function contained by the first element of MyArray, while <code>%MyVar%()</code> would call the function contained by the <em>variable</em> whose <em>name</em> is contained by MyVar. In other words, the expression preceding the parameter list is first evaluated to get a <a href="misc/Functor.htm">function object</a>, then that object is called.</p>
<p>If the target value cannot be called due to one of the reasons below, an <a href="lib/Error.htm">Error</a> is thrown:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the target value is not of a type that can be called, a <a href="lib/Error.htm#MethodError">MethodError</a> is thrown. Any value with a Call method can be called, so <code>HasMethod(value, "Call")</code> can be used to avoid this error.</li>
  <li>Passing too few or too many parameters, which can often be avoided by checking the function's <a href="lib/Func.htm#MinParams">MinParams</a>, <a href="lib/Func.htm#MaxParams">MaxParams</a> and <a href="lib/Func.htm#IsVariadic">IsVariadic</a> properties.</li>
  <li>Passing something other than a <a href="Concepts.htm#variable-references">variable reference (VarRef)</a> to a <a href="#ByRef">ByRef</a> or OutputVar parameter, which could be avoided through the use of the <a href="lib/Func.htm#IsByRef">IsByRef method</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The caller of a function should generally know what each parameter means and how many there are before calling the function. However, for dynamic calls, the function is often written to suit the function call, and in such cases failure might be caused by a mistake in the function definition rather than incorrect parameter values.</p>

<h2 id="ShortCircuit">Short-circuit Boolean Evaluation</h2>
<p>When <em>AND, OR</em>, and the <a href="Variables.htm#ternary">ternary operator</a> are used within an <a href="Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>, they short-circuit to enhance performance (regardless of whether any function calls are present). Short-circuiting operates by refusing to evaluate parts of an expression that cannot possibly affect its final result. To illustrate the concept, consider this example:</p>
<pre>if (ColorName != "" AND not FindColor(ColorName))
    MsgBox ColorName " could not be found."</pre>
<p>In the example above, the FindColor() function never gets called if the <em>ColorName</em> variable is empty. This is because the left side of the <em>AND</em> would be <em>false</em>, and thus its right side would be incapable of making the final outcome <em>true</em>.</p>
<p>Because of this behavior, it's important to realize that any side-effects produced by a function (such as altering a global variable's contents) might never occur if that function is called on the right side of an <em>AND</em> or <em>OR</em>.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that short-circuit evaluation cascades into nested <em>AND</em>s and <em>OR</em>s. For example, in the following expression, only the leftmost comparison occurs whenever <em>ColorName</em> is blank. This is because the left side would then be enough to determine the final answer with certainty:</p>
<pre>if (ColorName = "" <u>OR</u> FindColor(ColorName, Region1) <u>OR</u> FindColor(ColorName, Region2))
    break   <em>; Nothing to search for, or a match was found.</em></pre>
<p>As shown by the examples above, any expensive (time-consuming) functions should generally be called on the right side of an <em>AND</em> or <em>OR</em> to enhance performance. This technique can also be used to prevent a function from being called when one of its parameters would be passed a value it considers inappropriate, such as an empty string.</p>
<p>The <a href="Variables.htm#ternary">ternary conditional operator (?:)</a> also short-circuits by not evaluating the losing branch.</p>

<h2 id="nested">Nested Functions</h2>
<p>A <em>nested</em> function is one defined inside another function. For example:</p>
<pre>
outer(x) {
    inner(y) {
        MsgBox(y, x)
    }
    inner("one")
    inner("two")
}
outer("title")
</pre>
<p>A nested function is not accessible by name outside of the function which immediately encloses it, but is accessible anywhere inside that function, including inside other nested functions (with exceptions).</p>
<p>By default, a nested function may access any <a href="#static">static</a> variable of any function which encloses it, even dynamically. However, a non-dynamic assignment inside a nested function typically resolves to a local variable if the outer function has neither a declaration nor a non-dynamic assignment for that variable.</p>
<p id="capture-var">By default, a nested function automatically "captures" a non-static local variable of an outer function when the following requirements are met:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The outer function must refer to the variable in at least one of the following ways:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>By declaring it with <code>local</code>, or as a parameter or nested function.</li>
      <li>As the non-dynamic target of an assignment or the <a href="Variables.htm#ref">reference operator (&amp;)</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The inner function (or a function nested inside it) must refer to the variable non-dynamically.</li>
</ol>
<p>A nested function which has captured variables is known as a <a href="#closures">closure</a>.</p>
<p>Non-static local variables of the outer function cannot be <a href="Language.htm#dynamic-variables">accessed dynamically</a> unless they have been captured.</p>
<p>Explicit declarations always take precedence over local variables of the function which encloses them. For example, <code>local x</code> declares a variable local to the current function, independent of any <code>x</code> in the outer function. <a href="#Global">Global</a> declarations in the outer function also affect nested functions, except where overridden by an explicit declaration.</p>
<p>If a function is declared <a href="#AssumeGlobal">assume-global</a>, any local or static variables created <em>outside</em> that function are not directly accessible to the function itself or any of its nested functions. By contrast, a nested function which is assume-static can still refer to variables from the outer function, unless the function itself is <a href="#static-functions">declared static</a>.</p>
<p>Functions are <a href="#AssumeLocal">assume-local</a> by default, and this is true even for nested functions, even those inside an <a href="#AssumeStatic">assume-static</a> function. However, if the outer function is <a href="#AssumeGlobal">assume-global</a>, nested functions behave as though assume-global by default, except that they can refer to local and static variables of the outer function.</p>
<p>Each function definition creates a read-only variable containing the function itself; that is, a <a href="lib/Func.htm">Func</a> or <a href="#closures">Closure</a> object. See below for examples of how this might be used.</p>

<h3 id="static-functions">Static functions</h3>
<p>Any nested function which does not capture variables is automatically static; that is, every call to the outer function references the same <a href="lib/Func.htm">Func</a>. The keyword <code>static</code> can be used to explicitly declare a nested function as static, in which case any non-static local variables of the outer function are ignored. For example:</p>
<pre>outer() {
    x := "outer value"
    static inner() {
        x := "inner value"  <em>; Creates a variable local to inner</em>
        MsgBox type(inner)  <em>; Displays "Func"</em>
    }
    inner()
    MsgBox x  <em>; Displays "outer value"</em>
}
outer()</pre>
<p>A static function cannot refer to other nested functions outside its own body unless they are explicitly declared static. Note that even if the function is <a href="#AssumeStatic">assume-static</a>, a non-static nested function may become a closure if it references a function parameter.</p>

<h3 id="closures">Closures</h3>
<p>A <em>closure</em> is a nested function bound to a set of <em>free variables</em>. Free variables are local variables of the outer function which are also used by nested functions. Closures allow one or more nested functions to share variables with the outer function even after the outer function returns.</p>
<p>To create a closure, simply define a nested function which refers to variables of the outer function. For example:</p>
<pre>
make_greeter(f)
{
    greet(subject)  <em>; This will be a closure due to f.</em>
    {
        MsgBox Format(f, subject)
    }
    return greet  <em>; Return the closure.</em>
}

g := make_greeter("Hello, {}!")
g(A_UserName)
g("World")
</pre>
<p>Closures may also be used with built-in functions, such as <a href="lib/SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a> or <a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>
app_hotkey(keyname, app_title, app_path)
{
    activate(keyname)  <em>; This will be a closure due to app_title and app_path.</em>
    {
        if WinExist(app_title)
            WinActivate
        else
            Run app_path
    }
    Hotkey keyname, activate
}
<em>; Win+N activates or launches Notepad.</em>
app_hotkey "#n", "ahk_class Notepad", "notepad.exe"
<em>; Win+W activates or launches WordPad.</em>
app_hotkey "#w", "ahk_class WordPadClass", "wordpad.exe"
</pre>
<p>A nested function is automatically a closure if it captures any non-static local variables of the outer function. The variable corresponding to the closure itself (such as <code>activate</code>) is also a non-static local variable, so any nested functions which refer to a closure are automatically closures.</p>
<p>Each call to the outer function creates new closures, distinct from any previous calls.</p>
<p id="circular-closure">It is best not to store a reference to a closure in any of the closure's own free variables, since that creates a <a href="Objects.htm#Circular_References">circular reference</a> which must be broken (such as by clearing the variable) before the closure can be freed. However, a closure may safely refer to itself and other closures by their original variables without creating a circular reference. For example:</p>
<pre>
timertest() {
    x := "tock!"
    tick() {
        MsgBox x           <em>; x causes this to become a closure.</em>
        SetTimer tick, 0   <em>; Using the closure's original var is safe.</em>
        ; SetTimer t, 0    <em>; Capturing t would create a circular reference.</em>
    }
    t := tick              <em>; This is okay because t isn't captured above.</em>
    SetTimer t, 1000
}
timertest()
</pre>

<h2 id="remarks">Return, Exit, and General Remarks</h2>
<p>If the flow of execution within a function reaches the function's closing brace prior to encountering a <a href="lib/Return.htm">Return</a>, the function ends and returns a blank value (empty string) to its caller. A blank value is also returned whenever the function explicitly omits <a href="lib/Return.htm">Return</a>'s parameter.</p>
<p>When a function uses <a href="lib/Exit.htm">Exit</a> to terminate the <a href="misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a>, its caller does not receive a return value at all. For example, the statement <code>Var := Add(2, 3)</code> would leave <code>Var</code> unchanged if <code>Add()</code> exits. The same thing happens if the function is exited because of <a href="lib/Throw.htm">Throw</a> or a runtime error (such as <a href="lib/Run.htm">running</a> a nonexistent file).</p>
<p>To call a function with one or more blank values (empty strings), use an empty pair of quotes as in this example: <code>FindColor(ColorName, "")</code>.</p>
<p>Since calling a function does not start a new <a href="misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, any changes made by a function to settings such as <a href="lib/SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> and <a href="lib/SetTitleMatchMode.htm">SetTitleMatchMode</a> will go into effect for its caller too.</p>
<p>When used inside a function, <a href="lib/ListVars.htm">ListVars</a> displays a function's <a href="#Local">local variables</a> along with their contents. This can help debug a script.</p>
<h2 id="Style_and_Naming_Conventions">Style and Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>You might find that complex functions are more readable and maintainable if their special variables are given a distinct prefix. For example, naming each parameter in a function's parameter list with a leading "p" or "p_" makes their special nature easy to discern at a glance, especially when a function has several dozen <a href="#Local">local variables</a> competing for your attention. Similarly, the prefix "r" or "r_" could be used for <a href="#ByRef">ByRef parameters</a>, and "s" or "s_" could be used for <a href="#static">static variables</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="lib/Block.htm#otb">One True Brace (OTB) style</a> may optionally be used to define functions. For example:</p>
<pre>Add(x, y) {
    return x + y
}</pre>

<h2 id="include">Using #Include to Share Functions Among Multiple Scripts</h2>
<p>The <a href="lib/_Include.htm">#Include</a> directive may be used to load functions from an external file.</p>

<h2 id="BuiltIn">Built-in Functions</h2>
<p>A built-in function is overridden if the script defines its own function of the same name. For example, a script could have its own custom WinExist function that is called instead of the standard one. However, the script would then have no way to call the original function.</p>
<p>External functions that reside in DLL files may be called with <a href="lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>.</p>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<h3 id="easy-to-reach">Remap easy to reach but rarely used keys</h3>
<p>Some of the easiest keys to reach on the keyboard are also the least frequently used. Make these keys do something useful! For example, if you rarely use the right <kbd>Alt</kbd>, make it perform the action you do most often:</p>
<pre>RAlt::MsgBox "You pressed the right ALT key."</pre>
<p>You can even do the above without losing the native function of the right <kbd>Alt</kbd> by assigning the right <kbd>Alt</kbd> to be a "prefix" for at least one other hotkey. In the below example, the right <kbd>Alt</kbd> has become a prefix, which automatically allows it to modify <strong>all</strong> other keys as it normally would. But if you press and release the right <kbd>Alt</kbd> without having used it to modify another key, its hotkey action (above) will take effect immediately:</p>
<pre>RAlt &amp; j::AltTab</pre>

<h3 id="keys-as-modifiers">Use any keys as modifiers</h3>
<p>Don't be limited to using only <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, and <kbd>Win</kbd> as modifiers; you can combine <strong>any</strong> two keys or mouse buttons to form a custom hotkey. For example: Hold down Numpad0 and press Numpad1 to launch a hotkey (<code>Numpad0 &amp; Numpad1::</code>); hold down <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> and press another key, or click a mouse button (<code>CapsLock &amp; RButton::</code>). In this case, <kbd>CapsLock</kbd>'s state (on or off) is not changed when it is used to launch the hotkey. For details, see <a href="Hotkeys.htm#combo">custom combinations of keys</a>.</p>

<h3 id="AltTab">Make the mouse wheel perform alt-tabbing</h3>
<p>Convert the mouse wheel (or any other keys of your choice) into a complete substitute for Alt-Tab. Click the wheel to show or hide the menu, and turn it to navigate through the menu. The wheel will still function normally whenever the Alt-Tab menu isn't visible. Syntax:</p>
<pre>MButton::AltTabMenu
WheelDown::AltTab
WheelUp::ShiftAltTab</pre>

<h3 id="keyboard-to-mouse">Make a keyboard key become a mouse button</h3>
<p>Make a keyboard key <strong>become</strong> a mouse button, or have an action repeated continuously while you're holding down a key or mouse button. See the <a href="misc/Remap.htm#RemapMouse">remapping page</a> for examples.</p>

<h3 id="context-sensitive">Make your hotkeys context-sensitive</h3>
<p>Have your easiest-to-reach hotkeys perform an action appropriate to the type of window you're working with. In the following example, the right <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> performs a different action depending on whether Notepad or Calculator is the active window:</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActive("ahk_class Notepad")
RControl::Send "^s"  <em>; Save the current file in Notepad.</em>

#HotIf WinActive("Calculator")
RControl::Send "^c!{tab}^v"  <em>; Copy the Calculator's result into the previously active window.</em></pre>
<p>See <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> for details.</p>

<h3 id="hotstrings">Define abbreviations that expand as you type them</h3>
<p>Also known as <a href="Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a>. No special training or scripting experience is needed.  For example, a script containing the following lines would expand ceo, cfo, and btw wherever you type them:</p>
<pre>::ceo::Chief Executive Officer
::cfo::Chief Financial Officer
::btw::by the way</pre>

<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>

<h3 id="wear-and-tear">Reduce wear and tear on your fingers</h3>
<p>Reduce wear and tear on your fingers by using virtually <a href="KeyList.htm">any key</a> as a hotkey, including single letters, arrow keys, Numpad keys, and even the modifier keys themselves (Ctrl, Alt, Win, and Shift).</p>

<h3 id="mouse-hotkeys">Create mouse hotkeys</h3>
<p>Create mouse hotkeys, including the mouse wheel button (MButton) and the turning of the wheel up/down or left/right (WheelUp, WheelDown, WheelLeft, and WheelRight). You can also combine a keyboard key with a mouse button. For example, control-right-button would be expressed as <code>^RButton::</code>.</p>

<h3 id="pass-through">Create "pass-through" hotkeys</h3>
<p>For example, the left mouse button can trigger a hotkey action even while the click itself is being sent  into the game normally (syntax: <code>~LButton::</code>).</p>

<h3 id="game-actions">Automate game actions on the screen</h3>
<p>Use functions such as <a href="lib/PixelSearch.htm">PixelSearch</a>, <a href="lib/PixelGetColor.htm">PixelGetColor</a>, and <a href="lib/ImageSearch.htm">ImageSearch</a> to automate game actions.</p>

<h3 id="keyboard-hook">Use the keyboard hook</h3>
<p>Have the option of using the <a href="lib/_UseHook.htm">keyboard hook</a> to implement hotkeys, which might be more responsive than other hotkey methods while the CPU is under load in a game. The hook might also be able to override any restrictions a game may have about which keys can be "mapped" to game actions.</p>

<h2 id="Intro">Introduction and Simple Examples</h2>
<p>Hotkeys are sometimes referred to as shortcut keys because of their ability to easily trigger an action (such as launching a program or <a href="misc/Macros.htm">keyboard macro</a>). In the following example, the hotkey <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> is configured to launch Notepad. The pound sign [#] stands for <kbd>Win</kbd>, which is known as a <em>modifier key</em>:</p>
<pre>#n::
{
    Run "notepad"
}</pre>
<p>In the above, the braces serve to define a <a href="Functions.htm">function body</a> for the hotkey. The opening brace may also be specified on the same line as the double-colon to support the <a href="lib/Block.htm#otb">OTB (One True Brace) style</a>. However, if a hotkey needs to execute only a single line, that line can be listed to the right of the double-colon. In other words, the braces are implicit:</p>
<pre>#n::Run "notepad"</pre>
<p id="ThisHotkey">When a hotkey is triggered, the name of the hotkey is passed as its first parameter named <code>ThisHotkey</code> (which excludes the trailing colons). For example:</p>
<pre>#n::MsgBox ThisHotkey  <em>; Reports #n</em></pre>
<p>With few exceptions, this is similar to the built-in variable <a href="Variables.htm#ThisHotkey">A_ThisHotkey</a>. The parameter name can be changed by using a <a href="#Function">named function</a>.</p>
<p>To use more than one modifier with a hotkey, list them consecutively (the order does not matter). The following example uses <code>^!s</code> to indicate <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>:</p>
<pre>^!s::
{
    <a href="lib/Send.htm">Send</a> "Sincerely,{enter}John Smith"  <em>; This line sends keystrokes to the active (foremost) window.</em>
}</pre>
<h2 id="Symbols">Hotkey Modifier Symbols</h2>
<p>You can use the following modifier symbols to define hotkeys:</p>
<table class="info fixed">
  <tr>
    <th class="center" style="width:30px">Symbol</th>
    <th abbr="Descr">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center bold">#</td>
    <td>
      <p>Win (Windows logo key).</p>
      <p id="win-l">Hotkeys that include <kbd>Win</kbd> (e.g. #a) will wait for <kbd>Win</kbd> to be released before sending any text containing an <kbd>L</kbd> keystroke. This prevents usages of <a href="lib/Send.htm">Send</a> within such a hotkey from locking the PC. This behavior applies to all sending modes except <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a> (which doesn't need it), <a href="lib/Send.htm#blind">blind mode</a> and <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendText">text mode</a>.</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pressing a hotkey which includes <kbd>Win</kbd> may result in extra simulated keystrokes (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> by default). See <a href="lib/A_MenuMaskKey.htm">A_MenuMaskKey</a>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center bold">!</td>
    <td>
      <p><kbd>Alt</kbd></p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pressing a hotkey which includes <kbd>Alt</kbd> may result in extra simulated keystrokes (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> by default). See <a href="lib/A_MenuMaskKey.htm">A_MenuMaskKey</a>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center bold">^</td>
    <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center bold">+</td>
    <td><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center bold">&amp;</td>
    <td>An ampersand may be used between any two keys or mouse buttons to combine them into a custom hotkey. See <a href="#combo">below</a> for details.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="LeftRight">
    <td class="center bold">&lt;</td>
    <td>Use the left key of the pair. e.g. &lt;!a is the same as !a except that only the left <kbd>Alt</kbd> will trigger it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="center bold">&gt;</td>
    <td>Use the right key of the pair.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="AltGr">
    <td class="center bold">&lt;^&gt;!</td>
    <td><p><kbd>AltGr</kbd> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key">alternate graph, or alternate graphic</a>). If your keyboard layout has <kbd>AltGr</kbd> instead of a right <kbd>Alt</kbd> key, this series of symbols can usually be used to stand for <kbd>AltGr</kbd>. For example:</p>
      <pre>&lt;^&gt;!m::MsgBox "You pressed AltGr+m."
&lt;^&lt;!m::MsgBox "You pressed LeftControl+LeftAlt+m."</pre>
      <p>Alternatively, to make <kbd>AltGr</kbd> itself into a hotkey, use the following hotkey (without any hotkeys like the above present):</p>
      <pre>LControl &amp; RAlt::MsgBox "You pressed AltGr itself."</pre></td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="wildcard">
    <td class="center bold">*</td>
    <td><p>Wildcard: Fire the hotkey even if extra modifiers are being held down. This is often used in conjunction with <a href="misc/Remap.htm">remapping</a> keys or buttons. For example:</p>
      <pre>*#c::Run "calc.exe"  <em>; Win+C, Shift+Win+C, Ctrl+Win+C, etc. will all trigger this hotkey.</em>
*ScrollLock::Run "notepad"  <em>; Pressing ScrollLock will trigger this hotkey even when modifier key(s) are down.</em></pre>
      <p>Wildcard hotkeys always use the keyboard hook, as do any hotkeys eclipsed by a wildcard hotkey. For example, the presence of <code>*a::</code> would cause <code>^a::</code> to always use the hook.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="Tilde">
    <td class="center bold">~</td>
    <td><p>When the hotkey fires, its key's native function will not be blocked (hidden from the system). In both of the below examples, the user's click of the mouse button will be sent to the active window:</p>
      <pre>~RButton::MsgBox "You clicked the right mouse button."
~RButton &amp; C::MsgBox "You pressed C while holding down the right mouse button."</pre>
      <p>Unlike the other prefix symbols, the tilde prefix is allowed to be present on some of a hotkey's <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm#variant">variants</a> but absent on others. However, if a tilde is applied to the <a href="#prefix">prefix key</a> of any custom combination which has not been turned off or suspended, it affects the behavior of that prefix key for <em>all</em> combinations.</p>
      <p>Special hotkeys that are substitutes for <a href="#alttab">alt-tab</a> always ignore the tilde prefix.</p>
      <p>If the tilde prefix is applied to a custom modifier key (<a href="#prefix">prefix key</a>) which is also used as its own hotkey, that hotkey will fire when the key is pressed instead of being delayed until the key is released.  For example, the <em>~RButton</em> hotkey above is fired as soon as the button is pressed.</p>
      <p>If the tilde prefix is applied only to the custom combination and not the non-combination hotkey, the key's native function will still be blocked. For example, in the script below, holding <kbd>Menu</kbd> will show the tooltip and will not trigger a context menu:</p>
      <pre>AppsKey::ToolTip "Press &lt; or &gt; to cycle through windows."
AppsKey Up::ToolTip
~AppsKey &amp; &lt;::Send "!+{Esc}"
~AppsKey &amp; &gt;::Send "!{Esc}"</pre>
      <p>If at least one variant of a keyboard hotkey has the tilde modifier, that hotkey always uses the keyboard hook.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="prefixdollar">
    <td class="center bold">$</td>
    <td>
      <p>This is usually only necessary if the script uses the <a href="lib/Send.htm">Send</a> function to send the keys that comprise the hotkey itself, which might otherwise cause it to trigger itself. The $ prefix forces the <a href="lib/InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard hook</a> to be used to implement this hotkey, which as a side-effect prevents the <a href="lib/Send.htm">Send</a> function from triggering it. The $ prefix is equivalent to having specified <code><a href="lib/_UseHook.htm">#UseHook</a></code> somewhere above the definition of this hotkey.</p>
      <p>The $ prefix has no effect for mouse hotkeys, since they always use the mouse hook. It also has no effect for hotkeys which already require the keyboard hook, including any keyboard hotkeys with the <a href="#Tilde">tilde (~)</a> or <a href="#wildcard">wildcard (*)</a> modifiers, key-up hotkeys and custom combinations. To determine whether a particular hotkey uses the keyboard hook, use <a href="lib/ListHotkeys.htm">ListHotkeys</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="lib/_InputLevel.htm">#InputLevel</a> and <a href="lib/SendLevel.htm">SendLevel</a> provide additional control over which hotkeys and hotstrings are triggered by the Send function.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="keyup">
    <td class="center">UP</td>
    <td><p>The word UP may follow the name of a hotkey to cause the hotkey to fire upon release of the key rather than when the key is pressed down. The following example <a href="misc/Remap.htm">remaps</a> the left <kbd>Win</kbd> to become the left <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>:</p>
      <pre>*LWin::Send "{LControl down}"
*LWin Up::Send "{LControl up}"
</pre>
      <p>"Up" can also be used with normal hotkeys as in this example: <code>^!r Up::MsgBox "You pressed and released Ctrl+Alt+R"</code>. It also works with <a href="#combo">combination hotkeys</a> (e.g. <code>F1 &amp; e Up::</code>)</p>
      <p>Limitations: 1) "Up" does not work with <a href="KeyList.htm">joystick buttons</a>; and 2) An "Up" hotkey without a normal/down counterpart hotkey will completely take over that key to prevent it from getting stuck down. One way to prevent this is to add a <a href="#Tilde">tilde prefix</a> (e.g. <code>~LControl up::</code>)</p>
      <p>"Up" hotkeys and their key-down counterparts (if any) always use the keyboard hook.</p>
      <p>On a related note, a technique similar to the above is to make a hotkey into a prefix key. The advantage is that although the hotkey will fire upon release, it will do so only if you did not press any other key while it was held down. For example:</p>
      <pre>LControl &amp; F1::return  <em>; Make left-control a prefix by using it in front of "&amp;" at least once.</em>
LControl::MsgBox "You released LControl without having used it to modify any other key."</pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: See the <a href="KeyList.htm">Key List</a> for a complete list of keyboard keys and mouse/joystick buttons.</p>
<p>Multiple hotkeys can be stacked vertically to have them perform the same action. For example:</p>
<pre>^Numpad0::
^Numpad1::
{
    MsgBox "Pressing either Ctrl+Numpad0 or Ctrl+Numpad1 will display this."
}
</pre>
<p>A key or key-combination can be disabled for the entire system by having it do nothing. The following example disables the right-side <kbd>Win</kbd>:</p>
<pre>RWin::return</pre>

<h2 id="Context">Context-sensitive Hotkeys</h2>
<p>The <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> directive can be used to make a hotkey perform a different action (or none at all) depending on a specific condition. For example:</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActive("ahk_class Notepad")
^a::MsgBox "You pressed Ctrl-A while Notepad is active. Pressing Ctrl-A in any other window will pass the Ctrl-A keystroke to that window."
#c::MsgBox "You pressed Win-C while Notepad is active."

#HotIf
#c::MsgBox "You pressed Win-C while any window except Notepad is active."

#HotIf MouseIsOver("ahk_class Shell_TrayWnd") <em>; For MouseIsOver, see <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm#ExVolume">#HotIf example 1</a>.</em>
WheelUp::Send "{Volume_Up}"     <em>; Wheel over taskbar: increase/decrease volume.</em>
WheelDown::Send "{Volume_Down}" <em>;</em>
</pre>

<h2 id="combo">Custom Combinations</h2>
<p>Normally shortcut key combinations consist of optional prefix/modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift and LWin/RWin) and a single suffix key. The standard modifier keys are designed to be used in this manner, so normally have no immediate effect when pressed down.</p>
<p>A custom combination of two keys (including mouse but not joystick buttons) can be defined by using " &amp; " between them. Because they are intended for use with prefix keys that are not normally used as such, custom combinations have the following special behavior:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The prefix key loses its native function, unless it is a standard modifier key or toggleable key such as <kbd>CapsLock</kbd>.</li>
  <li>If the prefix key is also used as a suffix in another hotkey, by default that hotkey is fired upon release, and is not fired at all if it was used to activate a custom combination. If there is both a key-down hotkey and a <a href="#keyup">key-up</a> hotkey, both hotkeys are fired at once. The fire-on-release effect is disabled if the <a href="#Tilde">tilde prefix</a> is applied to the prefix key in at least one active custom combination or the suffix hotkey itself.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For combinations with standard modifier keys, it is usually better to use the standard syntax. For example, use <code>&lt;+s::</code> rather than <code>LShift &amp; s::</code>.</p>
<p>In the below example, you would hold down Numpad0 then press the second key to trigger the hotkey:</p>
<pre id="prefix">Numpad0 &amp; Numpad1::MsgBox "You pressed Numpad1 while holding down Numpad0."
Numpad0 &amp; Numpad2::Run "Notepad"</pre>
<p><strong>The prefix key loses its native function:</strong> In the above example, Numpad0 becomes a <em>prefix key</em>; but this also causes Numpad0 to lose its original/native function when it is pressed by itself. To avoid this, a script may configure Numpad0 to perform a new action such as one of the following:</p>
<pre>Numpad0::WinMaximize "A"   <em>; Maximize the active/foreground window.</em>
Numpad0::Send "{Numpad0}"  <em>; Make the <i>release</i> of Numpad0 produce a Numpad0 keystroke. See comment below.</em></pre>
<p><strong>Fire on release:</strong> The presence of one of the above custom combination hotkeys causes the <em>release</em> of Numpad0 to perform the indicated action, but only if you did not press any other keys while Numpad0 was being held down.  This behaviour can be avoided by applying the <a href="#Tilde">tilde prefix</a> to either hotkey.</p>
<p id="combo_mods"><strong>Modifiers:</strong> Unlike a normal hotkey, custom combinations act as though they have the <a href="#wildcard">wildcard (*)</a> modifier by default. For example, <code>1 &amp; 2::</code> will activate even if <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd> is held down when <kbd>1</kbd> and <kbd>2</kbd> are pressed, whereas <code>^1::</code> would be activated only by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> and not <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>.</p>
<p>Combinations of three or more keys are not supported. Combinations which your keyboard hardware supports can usually be detected by using <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> and <a href="lib/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a>, but the results may be inconsistent. For example:</p>
<pre><em>; Press AppsKey and Alt in any order, then slash (/).</em>
#HotIf GetKeyState("AppsKey", "P")
Alt &amp; /::MsgBox "Hotkey activated."

<em>; If the keys are swapped, Alt must be pressed first (use one at a time):</em>
#HotIf GetKeyState("Alt", "P")
AppsKey &amp; /::MsgBox "Hotkey activated."

<em>; [ &amp; ] &amp; \::</em>
#HotIf GetKeyState("[") &amp;&amp; GetKeyState("]")
\::MsgBox</pre>
<p><strong>Keyboard hook:</strong> Custom combinations involving keyboard keys always use the keyboard hook, as do any hotkeys which use the prefix key as a suffix. For example, <code>a &amp; b::</code> causes <code>^a::</code> to always use the hook.</p>

<h2 id="Features">Other Features</h2>
<p><strong>NumLock, CapsLock, and ScrollLock:</strong> These keys may be forced to be "AlwaysOn" or "AlwaysOff". For example: <code><a href="lib/SetNumScrollCapsLockState.htm">SetNumLockState</a> "AlwaysOn"</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Overriding Explorer's hotkeys:</strong> Windows' built-in hotkeys such as <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> (#e) and <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> (#r) can be individually overridden simply by assigning them to an action in the script. See the <a href="misc/Override.htm">override page</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong>Substitutes for Alt-Tab:</strong> Hotkeys can provide an alternate means of alt-tabbing. For example, the following two hotkeys allow you to alt-tab with your right hand:</p>
<pre>RControl &amp; RShift::AltTab  <em>; Hold down right-control then press right-shift repeatedly to move forward.</em>
RControl &amp; Enter::ShiftAltTab  <em>; Without even having to release right-control, press Enter to reverse direction.</em></pre>
<p>For more details, see <a href="#alttab">Alt-Tab</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Wheel">Mouse Wheel Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Hotkeys that fire upon turning the mouse wheel are supported via the key names WheelDown and WheelUp. Here are some examples of mouse wheel hotkeys:</p>
<pre>MButton &amp; WheelDown::MsgBox "You turned the mouse wheel down while holding down the middle button."
^!WheelUp::MsgBox "You rotated the wheel up while holding down Control+Alt."</pre>
<p id="HWheel">If the mouse supports it, horizontal scrolling can be detected via the key names WheelLeft and WheelRight. Some mice have a single wheel which can be scrolled up and down or tilted left and right. Generally in those cases, WheelLeft or WheelRight signals are sent repeatedly while the wheel is held to one side, to simulate continuous scrolling. This typically causes the hotkeys to execute repeatedly.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_EventInfo</strong> contains the amount by which the wheel was turned, which is typically 120. However, A_EventInfo can be greater or less than 120 under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the mouse hardware reports distances of less than one notch, A_EventInfo may be less than 120;</li>
  <li>If the wheel is being turned quickly (depending on the type of mouse), A_EventInfo may be greater than 120. A hotkey like the following can help analyze your mouse: <code>~WheelDown::ToolTip A_EventInfo</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most useful hotkeys for the mouse wheel involve alternate modes of scrolling a window's text. For example, the following pair of hotkeys scrolls horizontally instead of vertically when you turn the wheel while holding down the left <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>:</p>
<pre>~LControl &amp; WheelUp::  <em>; Scroll left.</em>
{
    Loop 2  <em>; &lt;-- Increase this value to scroll faster.</em>
        SendMessage 0x0114, 0, 0, ControlGetFocus("A")  <em>; 0x0114 is WM_HSCROLL and the 0 after it is SB_LINELEFT.</em>
}

~LControl &amp; WheelDown::  <em>; Scroll right.</em>
{
    Loop 2  <em>; &lt;-- Increase this value to scroll faster.</em>
        SendMessage 0x0114, 1, 0, ControlGetFocus("A")  <em>; 0x0114 is WM_HSCROLL and the 1 after it is SB_LINERIGHT.</em>
}</pre>
<p>Finally, since mouse wheel hotkeys generate only down-events (never up-events), they cannot be used as <a href="#keyup">key-up hotkeys</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Hotkey Tips and Remarks</h2>
<p>Each numpad key can be made to launch two different hotkey subroutines depending on the state of <kbd>NumLock</kbd>. Alternatively, a numpad key can be made to launch the same subroutine regardless of the state. For example:</p>
<pre>NumpadEnd::
Numpad1::
{
    MsgBox "This hotkey is launched regardless of whether NumLock is on."
}
</pre>
<p>If the <a href="#Tilde">tilde (~) operator</a> is used with a <a href="#prefix">prefix key</a> even once, it changes the behavior of that prefix key for all combinations. For example, in both of the below hotkeys, the active window will receive all right-clicks even though only one of the definitions contains a tilde:</p>
<pre>~RButton &amp; LButton::MsgBox "You pressed the left mouse button while holding down the right."
RButton &amp; WheelUp::MsgBox "You turned the mouse wheel up while holding down the right button."</pre>
<p>The <a href="lib/Suspend.htm">Suspend</a> function can temporarily disable all hotkeys except for ones you make exempt. For greater selectivity, use <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a>.</p>
<p>By means of the <a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> function, hotkeys can be created dynamically while the script is running. The Hotkey function can also modify, disable, or enable the script's existing hotkeys individually.</p>
<p>Joystick hotkeys do not currently support modifier prefixes such as ^ (Ctrl) and # (Win). However, you can use <a href="lib/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a> to mimic this effect as shown in the following example:</p>
<pre>Joy2::
{
    if not GetKeyState("Control")  <em>; Neither the left nor right Control key is down.</em>
        return  <em>; i.e. Do nothing.</em>
    MsgBox "You pressed the first joystick's second button while holding down the Control key."
}</pre>
<p>There may be times when a hotkey should wait for its own modifier keys to be released before continuing. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre>^!s::Send "{Delete}"</pre>
<p>Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> would cause the system to behave as though you pressed <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd> (due to the system's aggressive detection of this hotkey). To work around this, use <a href="lib/KeyWait.htm">KeyWait</a> to wait for the keys to be released; for example:</p>
<pre>^!s::
{
    KeyWait "Control"
    KeyWait "Alt"
    Send "{Delete}"
}
</pre>
<p>If a hotkey like <code>#z::</code> produces an error like "Invalid Hotkey", your system's keyboard layout/language might not have the specified character ("Z" in this case). Try using a different character that you know exists in your keyboard layout.</p>
<p>A hotkey's function can be called explicitly by the script only if the function has been named. See <a href="#Function">Named Function Hotkeys</a>.</p>
<p>One common use for hotkeys is to start and stop a repeating action, such as a series of keystrokes or mouse clicks. For an example of this, see <a href="FAQ.htm#repeat">this FAQ topic</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, each script is <a href="misc/Threads.htm">quasi multi-threaded</a>, which allows a new hotkey to be launched even when a previous hotkey subroutine is still running. For example, new hotkeys can be launched even while a <a href="lib/MsgBox.htm">message box</a> is being displayed by the current hotkey.</p>

<h2 id="alttab"><span id="AltTabDetail"></span>Alt-Tab Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Alt-Tab hotkeys simplify the mapping of new key combinations to the system's Alt-Tab hotkeys, which are used to invoke a menu for switching tasks (activating windows).</p>
<p>Each Alt-Tab hotkey must be either a single key or a combination of two keys, which is typically achieved via the ampersand symbol (&amp;). In the following example, you would hold down the right <kbd>Alt</kbd> and press <kbd>J</kbd> or <kbd>K</kbd> to navigate the alt-tab menu:</p>
<pre>RAlt &amp; j::AltTab
RAlt &amp; k::ShiftAltTab</pre>
<p><em>AltTab</em> and <em>ShiftAltTab</em> are two of the special commands that are only recognized when used on the same line as a hotkey. Here is the complete list:</p>
<p><strong>AltTab</strong>: If the alt-tab menu is visible, move forward in it. Otherwise, display the menu (only if the hotkey is a combination of two keys; otherwise, it does nothing).</p>
<p><strong>ShiftAltTab</strong>: Same as above except move backward in the menu.</p>
<p><strong>AltTabMenu</strong>: Show or hide the alt-tab menu.</p>
<p><strong>AltTabAndMenu</strong>: If the alt-tab menu is visible, move forward in it. Otherwise, display the menu.</p>
<p><strong>AltTabMenuDismiss</strong>: Close the Alt-tab menu.</p>
<p>To illustrate the above, the mouse wheel can be made into an entire substitute for Alt-tab. With the following hotkeys in effect, clicking the middle button displays the menu and turning the wheel navigates through it:</p>
<pre>MButton::AltTabMenu
WheelDown::AltTab
WheelUp::ShiftAltTab</pre>
<p>To cancel the Alt-Tab menu without activating the selected window, press or send <kbd>Esc</kbd>. In the following example, you would hold the left <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and press <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> to display the menu and advance forward in it. Then you would release the left <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to activate the selected window, or press the mouse wheel to cancel. Define the <a href="#AltTabWindow">AltTabWindow</a> window group as shown below before running this example.</p>
<pre>LCtrl &amp; CapsLock::AltTab
#HotIf WinExist("ahk_group AltTabWindow")  <em>; Indicates that the alt-tab menu is present on the screen.</em>
*MButton::Send "{Blind}{Escape}"  <em>; The * prefix allows it to fire whether or not Alt is held down.</em>
#HotIf</pre>
<p>If the script sent <code>{Alt Down}</code> (such as to invoke the Alt-Tab menu), it might also be necessary to send <code>{Alt Up}</code> as shown in the example further below.</p>

<h3 id="AltTabRemarks">General Remarks</h3>
<p>Currently, all special Alt-tab actions must be assigned directly to a hotkey as in the examples above (i.e. they cannot be used as though they were functions). They are <span class="red">not affected by <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a></span>.</p>
<p>An alt-tab action may take effect on key-down and/or key-up regardless of whether the <code>up</code> keyword is used, and cannot be combined with another action on the same key. For example, using both <code>F1::AltTabMenu</code> and <code>F1 up::OtherAction()</code> is unsupported.</p>
<p id="AltTabWindow">Custom alt-tab actions can also be created via hotkeys. As the identity of the alt-tab menu differs between OS versions, it may be helpful to use a window group as shown below. For the examples above and below which use <code>ahk_group AltTabWindow</code>, this window group is expected to be defined during <a href="Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>. Alternatively, <code>ahk_group AltTabWindow</code> can be replaced with the appropriate <code>ahk_class</code> for your system.</p>
<pre>GroupAdd "AltTabWindow", "ahk_class MultitaskingViewFrame"  <em>; Windows 10</em>
GroupAdd "AltTabWindow", "ahk_class TaskSwitcherWnd"  <em>; Windows Vista, 7, 8.1</em>
GroupAdd "AltTabWindow", "ahk_class #32771"  <em>; Older, or with classic alt-tab enabled</em></pre>
<p>In the following example, you would press <kbd>F1</kbd> to display the menu and advance forward in it. Then you would press <kbd>F2</kbd> to activate the selected window, or press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to cancel:</p>
<pre>*F1::Send "{Alt down}{tab}" <em>; Asterisk is required in this case.</em>
!F2::Send "{Alt up}"  <em>; Release the Alt key, which activates the selected window.</em>
#HotIf WinExist("ahk_group AltTabWindow")
~*Esc::Send "{Alt up}"  <em>; When the menu is cancelled, release the Alt key automatically.
;*Esc::Send "{Esc}{Alt up}"  ; Without tilde (~), Escape would need to be sent.</em>
#HotIf</pre>

<h2 id="Function">Named Function Hotkeys</h2>
<p>If the function of a hotkey is ever needed to be called without triggering the hotkey itself, one or more hotkeys can be assigned a named <a href="Functions.htm">function</a> by simply defining it immediately after the hotkey's double-colon as in this example:</p>
<pre><em>; Ctrl+Shift+O to open containing folder in Explorer.
; Ctrl+Shift+E to open folder with current file selected.
; Supports SciTE and Notepad++.</em>
^+o::
^+e::
    editor_open_folder(hk)
    {
        path := WinGetTitle("A")
        if RegExMatch(path, "\*?\K(.*)\\[^\\]+(?= [-*] )", &amp;path)
            if (FileExist(path[0]) &amp;&amp; hk = "^+e")
                Run Format('explorer.exe /select,"{1}"', path[0])
            else
                Run Format('explorer.exe "{1}"', path[1])
    }</pre>
<p>If the function <em>editor_open_folder</em> is ever called explicitly by the script, the first parameter (hk) must be passed a value.</p>
<p><a href="Hotstrings.htm">Hotstrings</a> can also be defined this way. Multiple hotkeys or hotstrings can be stacked together to call the same function.</p>
<p>There must only be whitespace or comments between the hotkey and the function name.</p>
<p>Naming the function also encourages self-documenting hotkeys, like in the code above where the function name describes the hotkey.</p>
<p>The <a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> function can also be used to assign a function or function object to a hotkey.</p>

  <li><a href="#Helper">Hotstring Helper</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction and Simple Examples</h2>
<p>Although hotstrings are mainly used to expand abbreviations as you type them (auto-replace), they can also be used to launch any scripted action. In this respect, they are similar to <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> except that they are typically composed of more than one character (that is, a string).</p>
<p>To define a hotstring, enclose the triggering abbreviation between pairs of colons as in this example:</p>
<pre>::btw::by the way</pre>
<p>In the above example, the abbreviation btw will be automatically replaced with "by the way" whenever you type it (however, by default you must type an <a href="#EndChars">ending character</a> after typing btw, such as <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>.</kbd>, or <kbd>Enter</kbd>).</p>
<p id="auto">The "by the way" example above is known as an auto-replace hotstring because the typed text is automatically erased and replaced by the string specified after the second pair of colons. By contrast, a hotstring may also be defined to perform any custom action as in the following examples. Note that the functions must appear <u>beneath</u> the hotstring:</p>
<pre>::btw::
{
    MsgBox 'You typed "btw".'
}

:*:]d::  <em>; This hotstring replaces "]d" with the current date and time via the functions below.</em>
{
    SendInput <a href="lib/FormatTime.htm">FormatTime</a>(, "M/d/yyyy h:mm tt")  <em>; It will look like 9/1/2005 3:53 PM</em>
}</pre>
<p>In the above, the braces serve to define a <a href="Functions.htm">function body</a> for each hotstring. The opening brace may also be specified on the same line as the double-colon to support the <a href="lib/Block.htm#otb">OTB (One True Brace) style</a>.</p>
<p>Even though the two examples above are not auto-replace hotstrings, the abbreviation you type is erased by default. This is done via automatic backspacing, which can be disabled via the <a href="#b0">b0 option</a>.</p>
<p id="ThisHotkey">When a hotstring is triggered, the name of the hotstring is passed as its first parameter named <code>ThisHotkey</code> (which excludes the trailing colons). For example:</p>
<pre>:X:btw::MsgBox ThisHotkey  <em>; Reports :X:btw</em></pre>
<p>With few exceptions, this is similar to the built-in variable <a href="Variables.htm#ThisHotkey">A_ThisHotkey</a>. The parameter name can be changed by using a <a href="#Function">named function</a>.</p>

<h2 id="EndChars">Ending Characters</h2>
<p>Unless the <a href="#Asterisk">asterisk option</a> is in effect, you must type an <em>ending character</em> after a hotstring's abbreviation to trigger it. Ending characters initially consist of the following: <strong>-()[]{}':;"/\,.?!`n `t</strong> (note that `n is <kbd>Enter</kbd>, `t is <kbd>Tab</kbd>, and there is a plain space between `n and `t). This set of characters can be changed by editing the following example, which sets the new ending characters for <u>all</u> hotstrings, not just the ones beneath it:</p>
<pre>#Hotstring EndChars -()[]{}:;'"/\,.?!`n`s`t</pre>
<p>The ending characters can be changed while the script is running by calling the <a href="lib/Hotstring.htm">Hotstring</a> function as demonstrated below:</p>
<pre>Hotstring("EndChars", "-()[]{}:;")</pre>

<h2 id="Options">Options</h2>
<p>A hotstring's default behavior can be changed in two possible ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <a href="lib/_Hotstring.htm">#Hotstring</a> directive, which affects all hotstrings physically beneath that point in the script. The following example puts the C and R options into effect: <code>#Hotstring <strong>c r</strong></code>.</li>
  <li>Putting options inside a hotstring's first pair of colons. The following example puts the C and * options (case sensitive and "ending character not required") into effect for a single hotstring: <code>:<strong>c*</strong>:j@::john@somedomain.com</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The list below describes each option. When specifying more than one option using the methods above, spaces optionally may be included between them.</p>
<p id="Asterisk"><strong>*</strong> (asterisk): An ending character (e.g. <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>.</kbd>, or <kbd>Enter</kbd>) is not required to trigger the hotstring. For example:</p>
<pre>:*:j@::jsmith@somedomain.com</pre>
<p>The example above would send its replacement the moment you type the @ character. When using the <a href="lib/_Hotstring.htm">#Hotstring directive</a>, use <strong>*0</strong> to turn this option back off.</p>
<p id="Question"><strong>?</strong> (question mark): The hotstring will be triggered even when it is inside another word; that is, when the character typed immediately before it is alphanumeric. For example, if <code>:?:al::airline</code> is a hotstring, typing "practical " would produce "practicairline ". Use <strong>?0</strong> to turn this option back off.</p>
<p id="b0"><strong>B0</strong> (B followed by a zero): Automatic backspacing is <u>not</u> done to erase the abbreviation you type. Use a plain <strong>B</strong> to turn backspacing back on after it was previously turned off. A script may also do its own backspacing via {bs 5}, which sends <kbd>Backspace</kbd> five times. Similarly, it may send <kbd>&larr;</kbd> five times via {left 5}. For example, the following hotstring produces "&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;" and moves the caret 5 places to the left (so that it's between the tags):</p>
<pre>:*b0:&lt;em&gt;::&lt;/em&gt;{left 5}</pre>
<p id="C"><strong>C</strong>: Case sensitive: When you type an abbreviation, it must exactly match the case defined in the script. Use <strong>C0</strong> to turn case sensitivity back off.</p>
<p id="C1"><strong>C1</strong>: Do not conform to typed case. Use this option to make <a href="#auto">auto-replace hotstrings</a> case insensitive and prevent them from conforming to the case of the characters you actually type. Case-conforming hotstrings (which are the default) produce their replacement text in all caps if you type the abbreviation in all caps. If you type the first letter in caps, the first letter of the replacement will also be capitalized (if it is a letter). If you type the case in any other way, the replacement is sent exactly as defined. When using the <a href="lib/_Hotstring.htm">#Hotstring directive</a>, <strong>C0</strong> can be used to turn this option back off, which makes hotstrings conform again.</p>
<p id="Kn"><strong>Kn</strong>: Key-delay: This rarely-used option sets the delay between keystrokes produced by auto-backspacing or <a href="#auto">auto-replacement</a>. Specify the new delay for <strong>n</strong>; for example, specify k10 to have a 10ms delay and k-1 to have no delay. The exact behavior of this option depends on which <a href="#SendMode">sending mode</a> is in effect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SI (SendInput): Key-delay is ignored because a delay is not possible in this mode. The exception to this is when SendInput is <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendInputUnavail">unavailable</a>, in which case hotstrings revert to SendPlay mode below (which does obey key-delay).</li>
  <li>SP (SendPlay): A delay of length zero is the default, which for SendPlay is the same as -1 (no delay). In this mode, the delay is actually a <a href="lib/SetKeyDelay.htm#dur">PressDuration</a> rather than a delay between keystrokes.</li>
  <li>SE (SendEvent): A delay of length zero is the default. Zero is recommended for most purposes since it is fast but still cooperates well with other processes (due to internally doing a <a href="lib/Sleep.htm">Sleep 0</a>). Specify k-1 to have no delay at all, which is useful to make auto-replacements faster if your CPU is frequently under heavy load. When set to -1, a script's process-priority becomes an important factor in how fast it can send keystrokes. To raise a script's priority, use <code><a href="lib/ProcessSetPriority.htm">ProcessSetPriority</a> "High"</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p id="O"><strong>O</strong>: Omit the ending character of <a href="#auto">auto-replace hotstrings</a> when the replacement is produced. This is useful when you want a hotstring to be kept unambiguous by still requiring an ending character, but don't actually want the ending character to be shown on the screen. For example, if <code>:o:ar::aristocrat</code> is a hotstring, typing "ar" followed by the spacebar will produce "aristocrat" with no trailing space, which allows you to make the word plural or possessive without having to press <kbd>Backspace</kbd>. Use <strong>O0</strong> (the letter O followed by a zero) to turn this option back off.</p>
<p id="Pn"><strong>Pn</strong>: The <a href="misc/Threads.htm">priority</a> of the hotstring (e.g. P1). This rarely-used option has no effect on <a href="#auto">auto-replace hotstrings</a>.</p>
<p id="raw"><strong>R</strong>: Send the replacement text <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendRaw">raw</a>; that is, without translating {Enter} to <kbd>Enter</kbd>, ^c to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, etc. Use <strong>R0</strong> to turn this option back off, or override it with <strong>T</strong>.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="#T">Text mode</a> may be more reliable. The R and T options are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p id="SuspendExempt"><strong>S</strong> or <strong>S0</strong>: Specify the letter S to make the hotstring <a href="lib/_SuspendExempt.htm">exempt</a> from <a href="lib/Suspend.htm">Suspend</a>. Specify S0 (S with the number 0) to remove the exemption, allowing the hotstring to be suspended. When applied as a default option, either <code>S</code> or <code>#SuspendExempt</code> will make the hotstring exempt; that is, to override the directive, <code>S0</code> must be used explicitly in the hotstring.</p>
<p id="SendMode"><strong>SI</strong> or <strong>SP</strong> or <strong>SE</strong>: Sets the method by which <a href="#auto">auto-replace hotstrings</a> send their keystrokes. These options are mutually exclusive: only one can be in effect at a time. The following describes each option:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SI stands for <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendInputDetail">SendInput</a>, which typically has superior speed and reliability than the other modes. Another benefit is that like SendPlay below, SendInput postpones anything you type during a hotstring's <a href="#auto">auto-replacement text</a>. This prevents your keystrokes from being interspersed with those of the replacement. When SendInput is <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendInputUnavail">unavailable</a>, hotstrings automatically use SendPlay instead.</li>
  <li>SP stands for <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a>, which may allow hotstrings to work in a broader variety of games.</li>
  <li>SE stands for <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendEvent">SendEvent</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of the above options are used, the default mode is SendInput. However, unlike the SI option, SendEvent is used instead of SendPlay when SendInput is unavailable.</p>
<p id="T"><strong>T</strong>: Send the replacement text using <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendText">Text mode</a>. That is, send each character by character code, without translating {Enter} to <kbd>Enter</kbd>, ^c to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, etc. and without translating each character to a keystroke. This option is put into effect automatically for hotstrings that have a <a href="#continuation">continuation section</a>. Use <strong>T0</strong> or <strong>R0</strong> to turn this option back off, or override it with <strong>R</strong>.</p>
<p id="X"><strong>X</strong>: Execute. Instead of replacement text, the hotstring accepts a function call or expression to execute. For example, <code>:X:~mb::MsgBox</code> would cause a message box to be displayed when the user types "~mb" instead of auto-replacing it with the word "MsgBox". This is most useful when defining a large number of hotstrings which call functions, as it would otherwise require three lines per hotstring.</p>
<p>This option should not be used with the <a href="lib/Hotstring.htm">Hotstring</a> function. To make a hotstring call a function when triggered, pass the function by reference.</p>
<p id="z"><strong>Z</strong>: This rarely-used option resets the hotstring recognizer after each triggering of the hotstring. In other words, the script will begin waiting for an entirely new hotstring, eliminating from consideration anything you previously typed. This can prevent unwanted triggerings of hotstrings. To illustrate, consider the following hotstring:</p>
<pre>:b0*?:11::
{
    SendInput "xx"
}</pre>
<p>Since the above lacks the Z option, typing 111 (three consecutive 1's) would trigger the hotstring twice because the middle 1 is the <em>last</em> character of the first triggering but also the <em>first</em> character of the second triggering. By adding the letter Z in front of b0, you would have to type four 1's instead of three to trigger the hotstring twice. Use <strong>Z0</strong> to turn this option back off.</p>
<h2 id="continuation">Long Replacements</h2>
<p>Hotstrings that produce a large amount of replacement text can be made more readable and maintainable by using a <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation">continuation section</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>::text1::
(
Any text between the top and bottom parentheses is treated literally.
By default, the hard carriage return (Enter) between the previous line and this one is also preserved.
    By default, the indentation (tab) to the left of this line is preserved.
)</pre>
<p>See <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation">continuation section</a> for how to change these default behaviors. The presence of a continuation section also causes the hotstring to default to <a href="#T">Text mode</a>. The only way to override this special default is to specify an opposing option in each hotstring that has a continuation section (e.g. <code>:t0:text1::</code> or <code>:r:text2::</code>).</p>
<h2 id="variant">Context-sensitive Hotstrings</h2>
<p>The <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> directive can be used to make selected hotstrings context sensitive. Such hotstrings send a different replacement, perform a different action, or do nothing at all depending on any condition, such as the type of window that is active. For example:</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActive("ahk_class Notepad")

<p>The following script uses hotstrings to correct about 4700 common English misspellings on-the-fly. It also includes a <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> hotkey to make it easy to add more misspellings:</p>

<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p><a href="Variables.htm#Expressions">Expressions</a> are not currently supported within the replacement text. To work around this, don't make such hotstrings <a href="#auto">auto-replace</a>. Instead, use the <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendInput">SendInput</a> function beneath the abbreviation, followed by a line containing only the word Return.</p>
<p>To send an extra space or tab after a replacement, include the space or tab at the end of the replacement but make the last character an accent/backtick (`). For example:</p>
<pre>:*:btw::By the way `</pre>
<p id="ReplaceBrace">For an auto-replace hotstring which doesn't use the <a href="#T">Text</a> or <a href="#raw">Raw</a> mode, sending a <code>{</code> alone, or one preceded only by white-space, requires it being enclosed in a pair of brackets, for example <code>:*:brace::{{}</code> and <code>:*:space_brace:: {{}</code>. Otherwise it is interpreted as the opening brace for the hotstring's function to support the <a href="lib/Block.htm#otb">OTB (One True Brace) style</a>.</p>
<p id="NoMouse">By default, any click of the left or right mouse button will reset the hotstring recognizer. In other words, the script will begin waiting for an entirely new hotstring, eliminating from consideration anything you previously typed (if this is undesirable, specify the line <code><a href="lib/_Hotstring.htm">#Hotstring</a> NoMouse</code> anywhere in the script). This "reset upon mouse click" behavior is the default because each click typically moves the text insertion point (caret) or sets keyboard focus to a new control/field. In such cases, it is usually desirable to: 1) fire a hotstring even if it lacks the <a href="#Question">question mark option</a>; 2) prevent a firing when something you type after clicking the mouse accidentally forms a valid abbreviation with what you typed before.</p>
<p id="focus-reset">The hotstring recognizer checks the active window each time a character is typed, and resets if a different window is active than before. If the active window changes but reverts before any characters are typed, the change is not detected (but the hotstring recognizer may be reset for some other reason). The hotstring recognizer can also be reset by calling <code><a href="lib/Hotstring.htm#Reset">Hotstring "Reset"</a></code>.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_EndChar</strong> contains the ending character that you typed to trigger the most recent non-auto-replace hotstring. If no ending character was required (due to the <a href="#Asterisk">* option</a>), it will be blank. A_EndChar is useful when making hotstrings that use the Send function or whose behavior should vary depending on which ending character you typed. To send the ending character itself, use <code>SendText A_EndChar</code> (<a href="lib/Send.htm">SendText</a> is used because characters such as !{} would not be sent correctly by the normal Send function).</p>
<p>Although single-colons within hotstring definitions do not need to be <a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm">escaped</a> unless they precede the double-colon delimiter, backticks and those semicolons having a space or tab to their left must always be escaped. See <a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm">Escape Sequences</a> for a complete list.</p>
<p>Although the <a href="lib/Send.htm">Send function</a>'s special characters such as {Enter} are supported in <a href="#auto">auto-replacement text</a> (unless the <a href="#raw">raw option</a> is used), the hotstring abbreviations themselves do not use this. Instead, specify `n for <kbd>Enter</kbd> and `t (or a literal tab) for <kbd>Tab</kbd> (see <a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm">Escape Sequences</a> for a complete list). For example, the hotstring <code>:*:ab`t::</code> would be triggered when you type "ab" followed by a tab.</p>
<p>Spaces and tabs are treated literally within hotstring definitions. For example, the following would produce two different results: <code>::btw::by the way</code> and <code>::btw:: by the way</code>.</p>
<p>Each hotstring abbreviation can be no more than 40 characters long. The program will warn you if this length is exceeded. By contrast, the length of hotstring's replacement text is limited to about 5000 characters when the <a href="#SendMode">sending mode</a> is at its default of SendInput. That limit can be removed by switching to one of the other <a href="#SendMode">sending modes</a>, or by using <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a> or <a href="lib/Send.htm#SendEvent">SendEvent</a> in the body of the hotstring.</p>
<p>The order in which hotstrings are defined determines their precedence with respect to each other. In other words, if more than one hotstring matches something you type, only the one listed first in the script will take effect. Related topic: <a href="#variant">context-sensitive hotstrings</a>.</p>
<p>Any backspacing you do is taken into account for the purpose of detecting hotstrings. However, the use of <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>, <kbd>&rarr;</kbd>, <kbd>&darr;</kbd>, <kbd>&larr;</kbd>, <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>PgDn</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>, and <kbd>End</kbd> to navigate within an editor will cause the hotstring recognition process to reset. In other words, it will begin waiting for an entirely new hotstring.</p>
<p>A hotstring may be typed even when the active window is ignoring your keystrokes. In other words, the hotstring will still fire even though the triggering abbreviation is never visible. In addition, you may still press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to undo the most recently typed keystroke (even though you can't see the effect).</p>
<p>A hotstring's function can be called explicitly by the script only if the function has been named. See <a href="#Function">Named Function Hotstrings</a>.</p>
<p>Hotstrings are not monitored and will not be triggered while input is blocked by an invisible <a href="lib/InputHook.htm">Input hook</a>.</p>
<p id="InputLevel">By default, hotstrings are never triggered by keystrokes produced by any AutoHotkey script. This avoids the possibility of an infinite loop where hotstrings trigger each other over and over. This behaviour can be controlled with <a href="lib/_InputLevel.htm">#InputLevel</a> and <a href="lib/SendLevel.htm">SendLevel</a>. However, auto-replace hotstrings always use send level 0 and therefore never trigger <a href="lib/_UseHook.htm">hook hotkeys</a> or hotstrings.</p>
<p>Hotstrings can be created dynamically by means of the <a href="lib/Hotstring.htm">Hotstring</a> function, which can also modify, disable, or enable the script's existing hotstrings individually.</p>
<p>The <a href="lib/InputHook.htm">InputHook</a> function is more flexible than hotstrings for certain purposes. For example, it allows your keystrokes to be invisible in the active window (such as a game). It also supports non-character ending keys such as <kbd>Esc</kbd>.</p>
<p>The <a href="lib/InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard hook</a> is automatically used by any script that contains hotstrings.</p>
<p>Hotstrings behave identically to hotkeys in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are affected by the <a href="lib/Suspend.htm">Suspend</a> function.</li>
  <li>They obey <a href="lib/_MaxThreads.htm">#MaxThreads</a> and <a href="lib/_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> (but not <a href="lib/_MaxThreadsBuffer.htm">#MaxThreadsBuffer</a>).</li>
  <li>Scripts containing hotstrings are automatically <a href="Scripts.htm#persistent">persistent</a>.</li>
  <li>Non-auto-replace hotstrings will create a new <a href="misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> when launched. In addition, they will update the built-in hotkey variables such as <a href="Variables.htm#ThisHotkey">A_ThisHotkey</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Known limitation: On some systems in Java applications, hotstrings might interfere with the user's ability to type diacritical letters (via dead keys).  To work around this, <a href="lib/Suspend.htm">Suspend</a> can be turned on temporarily (which disables all hotstrings).</p>

<h2 id="Function">Named Function Hotstrings</h2>
<p>If the function of a hotstring is ever needed to be called without triggering the hotstring itself, one or more hotstrings can be assigned a named <a href="Functions.htm">function</a> by simply defining it immediately after the hotstring's double-colon, as in this example:</p>
<pre><em>; This example also demonstrates one way to implement case conformity in a script.</em>
:C:BTW::  <em>; Typed in all-caps.</em>
:C:Btw::  <em>; Typed with only the first letter upper-case.</em>
: :btw::  <em>; Typed in any other combination.</em>
    case_conform_btw(hs) <em>; hs will hold the name of the hotstring which triggered the function.</em>
    {
        if (hs == ":C:BTW")
            Send "BY THE WAY"
        else if (hs == ":C:Btw")
            Send "By the way"
        else
            Send "by the way"
    }
</pre>
<p>If the function <em>case_conform_btw</em> is ever called explicitly by the script, the first parameter (hs) must be passed a value.</p>
<p><a href="Hotkeys.htm">Hotkeys</a> can also be defined this way. Multiple hotkeys or hotstrings can be stacked together to call the same function.</p>
<p>There must only be whitespace or comments between the hotstring and the function name.</p>
<p>Naming the function also encourages self-documenting hotstrings, like in the code above where the function name describes the hotstring.</p>
<p>The <a href="lib/Hotstring.htm">Hotstring</a> function can also be used to assign a function or function object to a hotstring.</p>

<h2 id="Helper">Hotstring Helper</h2>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="lib/Hotstring.htm#ExHelper">first example</a> in the example section of the <a href="lib/Hotstring.htm">Hotstring</a> function's page, which might be useful if you are a heavy user of hotstrings. By pressing <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> (or another hotkey of your choice), the currently selected text can be turned into a hotstring.  For example, if you have "by the way" selected in a word processor, pressing <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> will prompt you for its abbreviation (e.g. btw), add the new hotstring to the script and activate it.</p>

<h2 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>A special thanks to Jonathan Bennett, whose generosity in releasing  AutoIt v2 as free software in 1999 served as an inspiration and time-saver for myself and many others worldwide. In addition, many of AutoHotkey's enhancements to the AutoIt v2 command set, as well as the Window Spy and the old script compiler, were adapted directly from the AutoIt v3 source code. So thanks to Jon and the other AutoIt authors for those as well.</p>
<p>Finally, AutoHotkey would not be what it is today without <a href="misc/Acknowledgements.htm">these other individuals</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Joystick">Joystick</h2>
<p><strong>Joy1 through Joy32</strong>: The buttons of the joystick. To help determine the button numbers for your joystick, use this <a href="scripts/index.htm#JoystickTest">test script</a>. Note that <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkey prefix symbols</a> such as ^ (control) and + (shift) are not supported (though <a href="lib/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a> can be used as a substitute). Also note that the pressing of joystick buttons always "passes through" to the active window if that window is designed to detect the pressing of joystick buttons.</p>
<p>Although the following Joystick control names cannot be used as hotkeys, they can be used with <a href="lib/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>JoyX, JoyY, and JoyZ</strong>: The X (horizontal), Y (vertical), and Z (altitude/depth) axes of the joystick.</li>
  <li><strong>JoyR</strong>: The rudder or 4th axis of the joystick.</li>
  <li><strong>JoyU and JoyV</strong>: The 5th and 6th axes of the joystick.</li>
  <li><strong>JoyPOV</strong>: The point-of-view (hat) control.</li>
  <li><strong>JoyName</strong>: The name of the joystick or its driver.</li>
  <li><strong>JoyButtons</strong>: The number of buttons supported by the joystick (not always accurate).</li>
  <li><strong>JoyAxes</strong>: The number of axes supported by the joystick.</li>
  <li><strong>JoyInfo</strong>: Provides a string consisting of zero or more of the following letters to indicate the joystick's capabilities: <strong>Z</strong> (has Z axis), <strong>R</strong> (has R axis), <strong>U</strong> (has U axis), <strong>V</strong> (has V axis), <strong>P</strong> (has POV control), <strong>D</strong> (the POV control has a limited number of discrete/distinct settings), <strong>C</strong> (the POV control is continuous/fine). Example string: ZRUVPD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Multiple Joysticks</strong>: If the computer has more than one joystick and you want to use one beyond the first, include the joystick number (max 16) in front of the control name. For example, 2joy1 is the second joystick's first button.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have trouble getting a script to recognize your joystick, one person reported needing to specify a joystick number other than 1 even though  only a single joystick was present. It is unclear how this situation arises or whether it is normal, but experimenting with the joystick number in the <a href="scripts/index.htm#JoystickTest">joystick test script</a> can help determine if this applies to your system.</p>

<h2 id="SpecialKeys">Special Keys</h2>
<p>If your keyboard or mouse has a key not listed above, you might still be able to make it a hotkey by using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that at least one script is running that is using the <a href="lib/InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard hook</a>. You can tell if a script has the keyboard hook by opening its main window and selecting "View-&gt;<a href="lib/KeyHistory.htm">Key history</a>" from the menu bar.</li>
  <li>Double-click that script's tray icon to open its main window.</li>
  <li>Press one of the "mystery keys" on your keyboard.</li>
  <li>Select the menu item "View-&gt;<a href="lib/KeyHistory.htm">Key history</a>"</li>
  <li>Scroll down to the bottom of the page. Somewhere near the bottom are the key-down and key-up events for your key. NOTE: Some keys do not generate events and thus will not be visible here. If this is the case, you cannot directly make that particular key a hotkey because your keyboard driver or hardware handles it at a level too low for AutoHotkey to access. For possible solutions, see further below.</li>
  <li>If your key is detectable, make a note of the 3-digit hexadecimal value in the second column of the list (e.g. <strong>159</strong>).</li>
  <li>To define this key as a hotkey, follow this example:
<pre>
<strong>SC159::</strong>MsgBox ThisHotkey " was pressed." <em>; Replace 159 with your key's value.</em>
</pre>Also see <a href="Hotkeys.htm#ThisHotkey">ThisHotkey</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reverse direction</strong>: To remap some other key to <em>become</em> a "mystery key", follow this example:</p>
<pre><em>; Replace 159 with the value discovered above. Replace FF (if needed) with the
; key's virtual key, which can be discovered in the first column of the Key History screen.</em>
#c::Send "{vkFFsc159}" <em>; See <a href="lib/Send.htm#vk">Send {vkXXscYYY}</a> for more details.</em></pre>
<p><strong>Alternate solutions</strong>: If your key or mouse button is not detectable by the <a href="lib/KeyHistory.htm">Key History</a> screen, one of the following might help:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Reconfigure the software that came with your mouse or keyboard (sometimes accessible in the Control Panel or Start Menu) to have the "mystery key" send some other keystroke. Such a keystroke can then be defined as a hotkey in a script. For example, if you configure a mystery key to send <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>, you can then indirectly make that key as a hotkey by using <code>^F1::</code> in a script.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/38015-ahkhid-an-ahk-implementation-of-the-hid-functions/">AHKHID</a>. You can also try searching the <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/">forum</a> for a keywords like <code>RawInput*</code>, <code>USB HID</code> or <code>AHKHID</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following is a last resort and generally should be attempted only in desperation. This is because the chance of success is low and it may cause unwanted side-effects that are difficult to undo:<br>
      Disable or remove any extra software that came with your keyboard or mouse or change its driver to a more standard one such as the one built into the OS. This assumes there is such a driver for your particular keyboard or mouse and that you can live without the features provided by its custom driver and software.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="IME">CapsLock and IME</h2>
<p>Some configurations of Windows IME (such as Japanese input with English keyboard) use CapsLock to toggle between modes. In such cases, CapsLock is suppressed by the IME and cannot be detected by AutoHotkey. However, the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>CapsLock</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>CapsLock</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>CapsLock</kbd> shortcuts can be disabled with a workaround. Specifically, send a key-up to modify the state of the IME, but prevent any other effects by signalling the keyboard hook to suppress the event. The following function can be used for this purpose:</p>
<pre filename="SendSuppressedKeyUp.ahk">
<em>; The keyboard hook must be installed.</em>
InstallKeybdHook
SendSuppressedKeyUp(key) {
    DllCall("keybd_event"
        , "char", GetKeyVK(key)
        , "char", GetKeySC(key)
        , "uint", KEYEVENTF_KEYUP := 0x2
        , "uptr", KEY_BLOCK_THIS := 0xFFC3D450)
}
</pre>
<p>After copying the function into a script or saving it as <em>SendSuppressedKeyUp.ahk</em> in a <a href="Scripts.htm#lib">Lib folder</a> and adding <code>#Include &lt;SendSuppressedKeyUp&gt;</code> to the script, it can be used as follows:</p>
<pre>
<em>; Disable Alt+key shortcuts for the IME.</em>
~LAlt::SendSuppressedKeyUp "LAlt"

<em>; Test hotkey:</em>
!CapsLock::MsgBox A_ThisHotkey

<em>; Remap CapsLock to LCtrl in a way compatible with IME.</em>
*CapsLock::
{
    Send "{Blind}{LCtrl DownR}"
    SendSuppressedKeyUp "LCtrl"
}
*CapsLock up::
{
    Send "{Blind}{LCtrl Up}"
}
</pre>

<h1>Scripting Language</h1>
<p>An AutoHotkey script is basically a set of instructions for the program to follow, written in a custom language exclusive to AutoHotkey. This language bears some similarities to several other scripting languages, but also has its own unique strengths and pitfalls. This document describes the language and also tries to point out common pitfalls.</p>
<p class="note">See <a href="Concepts.htm">Concepts and Conventions</a> for more general explanation of various concepts utilised by AutoHotkey.</p>

<h2 id="general-conventions">General Conventions</h2>
<p><strong>Names:</strong> Variable and function names are not case sensitive (for example, <code>CurrentDate</code> is the same as <code>currentdate</code>). For details such as maximum length and usable characters, see <a href="Concepts.htm#names">Names</a>.</p>
<p><strong>No typed variables:</strong> Variables have no explicitly defined type; instead, a value of any type can be stored in any variable (excluding constants and built-in variables). Numbers may be automatically converted to strings (text) and vice versa, depending on the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Declarations are optional:</strong> Except where noted on the <a href="Functions.htm">functions page</a>, variables do not need to be declared. However, attempting to read a variable before it is given a value is considered an error.</p>
<p><strong>Spaces are mostly ignored:</strong> Indentation (leading space) is important for writing readable code, but is not required by the program and is generally ignored. Spaces and tabs are <em>generally</em> ignored at the end of a line and within an expression (except between quotes). However, spaces are significant in some cases, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#function-calls">Function</a> and method calls require there to be no space between the function/method name and <code>(</code>.</li>
  <li>Spaces are required when performing concatenation.</li>
  <li>Spaces may be required between two operators, to remove ambiguity.</li>
  <li>Single-line <a href="#comments">comments</a> require a leading space if they are not at the start of the line.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Line breaks are meaningful:</strong> Line breaks generally act as a statement separator, terminating the previous function call or other statement. (A <em>statement</em> is simply the smallest standalone element of the language that expresses some action to be carried out.) The exception to this is line continuation (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Line continuation:</strong> Long lines can be divided up into a collection of smaller ones to improve readability and maintainability. This is achieved by preprocessing, so is not part of the language as such. There are three methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Scripts.htm#continuation-line">Continuation prefix</a>: Lines that begin with an <a href="Variables.htm#operators">expression operator</a> (except ++ and --) are merged with the previous line. Lines are merged regardless of whether the line actually contains an expression.</li>
  <li><a href="Scripts.htm#continuation-expr">Continuation by enclosure</a>: A sub-expression enclosed in (), [] or {} can automatically span multiple lines in most cases.</li>
  <li><a href="Scripts.htm#continuation-section">Continuation section</a>: Multiple lines are merged with the line above the section, which starts with <code>(</code> and ends with <code>)</code> (both symbols must appear at the beginning of a line, excluding whitespace).</li>
</ul>
 

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p><em>Comments</em> are portions of text within the script which are ignored by the program. They are typically used to add explanation or disable parts of the code.</p>
<p>Scripts can be commented by using a semicolon at the beginning of a line. For example:</p>
<pre><em>; This entire line is a comment.</em></pre>
<p>Comments may also be added at the end of a line, in which case the semicolon must have at least one space or tab to its left. For example:</p>
<pre>Run "Notepad"  <em>; This is a comment on the same line as a function call.</em></pre>
<p>In addition, the <code><em>/*</em></code> and <code><em>*/</em></code> symbols can be used to comment out an entire section, as in this example:</p>
<pre><em>/*
MsgBox "This line is commented out (disabled)."
MsgBox "Common mistake:" */ " this does not end the comment."
MsgBox "This line is commented out."
*/</em>
MsgBox "This line is not commented out."
<em>/* This is also valid, but no other code can share the line. */</em>
MsgBox "This line is not commented out."
</pre>
<p>Excluding tabs and spaces, <code><em>/*</em></code> must appear at the start of the line, while <code><em>*/</em></code> can appear only at the start or end of a line. It is also valid to omit <code><em>*/</em></code>, in which case the remainder of the file is commented out.</p>
<p>Since comments are filtered out when the script is read from file, they do not impact performance or memory utilization.</p>

<h2 id="expressions">Expressions</h2>
<p><em>Expressions</em> are combinations of one or more <a href="Concepts.htm#values">values</a>, <a href="Concepts.htm#variables">variables</a>, <a href="#operators">operators</a> and <a href="#function-calls">function calls</a>. For example, <code>10</code>, <code>1+1</code> and <code>MyVar</code> are valid expressions. Usually, an expression takes one or more values as input, performs one or more operations, and produces a value as the result. The process of finding out the value of an expression is called <em>evaluation</em>. For example, the expression <code>1+1</code> <em>evaluates</em> to the number 2.</p>
<p>Simple expressions can be pieced together to form increasingly more complex expressions. For example, if <code>Discount/100</code> converts a discount percentage to a fraction, <code>1 - Discount/100</code> calculates a fraction representing the remaining amount, and <code>Price * (1 - Discount/100)</code> applies it to produce the net price.</p>
<p><em>Values</em> are <a href="Concepts.htm#numbers">numbers</a>, <a href="Concepts.htm#objects">objects</a> or <a href="Concepts.htm#strings">strings</a>. A <em>literal</em> value is one written physically in the script; one that you can see when you look at the code.</p>

<h3 id="strings">Strings / Text</h3>
<p class="note">For a more general explanation of strings, see <a href="Concepts.htm#strings">Strings</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>string</em>, or <em>string of characters</em>, is just a text value. In an expression, literal text must be enclosed in single or double quotation marks to differentiate it from a variable name or some other expression. This is often referred to as a <em>quoted literal string</em>, or just <em>quoted string</em>. For example, <code>"this is a quoted string"</code> and <code>'so is this'</code>.</p>
<p>To include an <em>actual</em> quote character inside a quoted string, use the <code>`"</code> or <code>`'</code> <a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm#quote">escape sequence</a> or enclose the character in the opposite type of quote mark. For example: <code>'She said, "An apple a day."'</code>.</p>
<p>Quoted strings can contain other <a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm">escape sequences</a> such as <code>`t</code> (tab), <code>`n</code> (linefeed), and <code>`r</code> (carriage return).</p>

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
<p class="note">For a basic explanation and general details about variables, see <a href="Concepts.htm#variables">Variables</a>.</p>
<p><em>Variables</em> can be used in an expression simply by writing the variable's name. For example, <code>A_ScreenWidth/2</code>. However, variables cannot be used inside a quoted string. Instead, variables and other values can be combined with text through a process called <a href="Variables.htm#concat"><em>concatenation</em></a>. There are two ways to <em>concatenate</em> values in an expression:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implicit concatenation: <code>"The value is " MyVar</code></li>
  <li>Explicit concatenation: <code>"The value is " . MyVar</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Implicit concatenation is also known as <em>auto-concat</em>. In both cases, the spaces preceding the variable and dot are mandatory.</p>
<p>The <a href="lib/Format.htm">Format</a> function can also be used for this purpose. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox Format("You are using AutoHotkey v{1} {2}-bit.", A_AhkVersion, A_PtrSize*8)</pre>
<p>To assign a value to a variable, use the <code>:=</code> <a href="Variables.htm#AssignOp">assignment operator</a>, as in <code>MyVar := "Some text"</code>.</p>
<p><em>Percent signs</em> within an expression are used to create <a href="#dynamic-variables">dynamic variable references</a>, but these are rarely needed.</p>

<h3 id="constants">Keyword Constants</h3>
<p>A constant is simply an unchangeable value, given a symbolic name. AutoHotkey currently has the following constants:</p>

<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>
<p><em>Operators</em> take the form of a symbol or group of symbols such as <code>+</code> or <code>:=</code>, or one of the words <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>is</code>, <code>in</code> or <code>contains</code>. They take one, two or three values as input and return a value as the result. A value or sub-expression used as input for an operator is called an <em>operand</em>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Unary</em> operators are written either before or after a single operand, depending on the operator. For example, <code>-x</code> or <code>not keyIsDown</code>.</li>
  <li><em>Binary</em> operators are written in between their two operands. For example, <code>1+1</code> or <code>2 * 5</code>.</li>
  <li>AutoHotkey has only one <em>ternary</em> operator, which takes the form <a href="Variables.htm#ternary"><code>condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some unary and binary operators share the same symbols, in which case the meaning of the operator depends on whether it is written before, after or in between two values. For example, <code>x-y</code> performs subtraction while <code>-x</code> inverts the sign of <code>x</code> (producing a positive value from a negative value and vice versa).</p>
<p>Operators of equal precedence such as multiply (<code>*</code>) and divide (<code>/</code>) are evaluated in left-to-right order unless otherwise specified in the <a href="Variables.htm#operators">operator table</a>. By contrast, an operator of lower precedence such as add (<code>+</code>) is evaluated after a higher one such as multiply (<code>*</code>). For example, <code>3 + 2 * 2</code> is evaluated as <code>3 + (2 * 2)</code>. Parentheses may be used to override precedence as in this example: <code>(3 + 2) * 2</code></p>

<h3 id="function-calls">Function Calls</h3>
<p class="note">For a general explanation of functions and related terminology, see <a href="Concepts.htm#functions">Functions</a>.</p>
<p><em>Functions</em> take a varying number of inputs, perform some action or calculation, and then <a href="Concepts.htm#return-a-value"><em>return</em></a> a result. The inputs of a function are called <a href="Concepts.htm#parameters"><em>parameters</em></a> or <em>arguments</em>. A function is <a href="Concepts.htm#call"><em>called</em></a> simply by writing the target function followed by parameters enclosed in parentheses. For example, <code>GetKeyState("Shift")</code> returns (evaluates to) 1 if <kbd>Shift</kbd> is being held down or 0 otherwise.</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> There must not be any space between the function and open parenthesis.</p>
<p>For those new to programming, the requirement for parentheses may seem cryptic or verbose at first, but they are what allows a function call to be combined with other operations. For example, the expression <code>GetKeyState("Shift", "P") and GetKeyState("Ctrl", "P")</code> returns 1 only if both keys are being physically held down.</p>
<p>Although a function call expression usually begins with a literal function name, the target of the call can be any expression which produces a <a href="misc/Functor.htm">function object</a>. In the expression <code>GetKeyState("Shift")</code>, <em>GetKeyState</em> is actually a variable reference, although it usually refers to a read-only variable containing a built-in function.</p>

<h4 id="function-call-statements">Function Call Statements</h4>
<p>If the return value of the function is not needed and the function name is written at the start of the line (or in other contexts which allow a <a href="Concepts.htm#statement">statement</a>, such as following <code>else</code> or a <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>), the parentheses can be omitted. In this case, the remainder of the line is taken as the function's parameter list. For example:</p>
<pre>result := MsgBox("This one requires parentheses.",, "OKCancel")
MsgBox "This one doesn't. The result was " result "."</pre>
<p>Parentheses can also be omitted when calling a <a href="Concepts.htm#methods">method</a> in this same context, but only when the target object is either a variable or a directly named property, such as <code>myVar.myMethod</code> or <code>myVar.myProp.myMethod</code>.</p>
<p>As with function call expressions, the target of a function call statement does not have to be a predefined function; it can instead be a variable containing a <a href="misc/Functor.htm">function object</a>.</p>
<p>A function call statement can <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation">span multiple lines</a>.</p>
<p>Function call statements have the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If there is a return value, it is always discarded.</li>
  <li>Like <a href="#control-flow">control flow statements</a>, they cannot be used inside an expression.</li>
  <li>When optional parameters are omitted, any commas at the <em>end</em> of the parameter list must also be omitted to prevent <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation-line">line continuation</a>.</li>
  <li>Function call statements cannot be <a href="Functions.htm#VariadicCall">variadic</a>, although they can pass a fixed number of parameters to a variadic function.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="optional-parameters">Optional Parameters</h4>
<p>Optional parameters can simply be left blank, but the delimiting comma is still required unless all subsequent parameters are also omitted. For example, the <a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> function can accept between one and four parameters. All of the following are valid:</p>
<pre>
Run "notepad.exe", "C:\"
Run "notepad.exe",, "Min"
Run("notepad.exe", , , &amp;notepadPID)
</pre>
<p id="unset">Within a <a href="Language.htm#function-calls">function call</a>, <a href="Variables.htm#square-brackets">array literal</a> or <a href="Variables.htm#curly-braces">object literal</a>, the keyword <code>unset</code> can be used to explicitly omit the parameter or value. An unset expression has one of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For a user-defined function, the parameter's <a href="Functions.htm#optional">default value</a> is used.</li>
  <li>For a built-in function, the parameter is considered to have been omitted.</li>
  <li>For an <a href="Variables.htm#square-brackets">array literal</a> such as <code>[var?]</code>, the element is included in the array's length but is given no value.</li>
  <li>For an <a href="Variables.htm#curly-braces">object literal</a> such as <code>{x: y?}</code>, the property is not assigned.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>unset</code> keyword can also be <a href="Functions.htm#unset">used in a function definition</a> to indicate that a parameter is optional but has no default value. When the function executes, the local variable corresponding to that parameter will have <a href="Concepts.htm#nothing">no value</a> if the parameter was omitted.</p>
<p>The <a href="Variables.htm#maybe">maybe operator (<em>var</em><strong>?</strong>)</a> can be used to pass or omit a variable depending on whether it has a value. For example, <code>Array(MyVar?)</code> is equivalent to <code>Array(IsSet(MyVar) ? MyVar : unset)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="operators-for-objects">Operators for Objects</h3>
<p>There are other symbols used in expressions which don't quite fit into any of the categories defined above, or that affect the meaning of other parts of the expression, as described below. These all relate to <em>objects</em> in some way. Providing a full explanation of what each construct does would require introducing more concepts which are outside the scope of this section.</p>
<p><code>Alpha.Beta</code> is often called <em>member access</em>. <em>Alpha</em> is an ordinary variable, and could be replaced with a function call or some other sub-expression which returns an object. When evaluated, the object is sent a request "give me the value of property <em>Beta</em>", "store this value in property <em>Beta</em>" or "call the method named <em>Beta</em>". In other words, <em>Beta</em> is a name which has meaning to the object; it is not a local or global variable.</p>
<p><code>Alpha.Beta()</code> is a <em>method call</em>, as described above. The parentheses can be omitted in specific cases; see <a href="#function-call-statements">Function Call Statements</a>.</p>
<p><code>Alpha.Beta[Param]</code> is a specialised form of member access which includes additional parameters in the request. While <em>Beta</em> is a simple name, <em>Param</em> is an ordinary variable or sub-expression, or a list of sub-expressions separated by commas (the same as in a function's parameter list). <a href="Functions.htm#VariadicCall">Variadic calls</a> are permitted.</p>
<p><code>Alpha.%vBeta%</code>, <code>Alpha.%vBeta%[Param]</code> and <code>Alpha.%vBeta%()</code> are also member access, but <em>vBeta</em> is a variable or sub-expression. This allows the name of the property or method to be determined while the script is running. Parentheses are required when calling a method this way.</p>
<p><code>Alpha[Index]</code> accesses the <em>default property</em> of <code>Alpha</code>, giving <code>Index</code> as a parameter. Both <em>Alpha</em> and <em>Index</em> are variables in this case, and could be replaced with virtually any sub-expression. This syntax is usually used to retrieve an element of an <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> or <a href="lib/Map.htm">Map</a>.</p>
<p id="array-literal"><code>[A, B, C]</code> creates an <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> with the initial contents A, B and C (all variables in this case), where A is element 1.</p>
<p id="object-literal"><code>{Prop1: Value1, Prop2: Value2}</code> creates an <a href="lib/Object.htm">Object</a> with properties literally named <em>Prop1</em> and <em>Prop2</em>. A value can later be retrieved by using the <em>member access</em> syntax described above. To evaluate a property name as an expression, enclose it in percent signs. For example: <code>{%NameVar%: ValueVar}</code>.</p>
<p><code>MyFunc(Params*)</code> is a <a href="Functions.htm#VariadicCall">variadic function call</a>. The asterisk must immediately precede the closing parenthesis at the end of the function's parameter list. <em>Params</em> must be a variable or sub-expression which returns an <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> or other enumerable object. Although it isn't valid to use <code>Params*</code> just anywhere, it can be used in an array literal (<code>[A, B, C, ArrayToAppend*]</code>) or property parameter list (<code>Alpha.Beta[Params*]</code> or <code>Alpha[Params*]</code>).</p>

<h3 id="expression-statements">Expression Statements</h3>
<p>Not all expressions can be used alone on a line. For example, a line consisting of just <code>21*2</code> or <code>"Some text"</code> wouldn't make any sense. An expression <em>statement</em> is an expression used on its own, typically for its side-effects. Most expressions with side-effects can be used this way, so it is generally not necessary to memorise the details of this section.</p>
<p>The following types of expressions can be used as statements:</p>
<p>Assignments, as in <code>x := y</code>, compound assignments such as <code>x += y</code>, and increment/decrement operators such as <code>++x</code> and <code>x--</code>.</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Known limitation:</strong> For <code>x++</code> and <code>x--</code>, there currently cannot be a space between the variable name and operator.</p>
<p>Function calls such as <code>MyFunc(Params)</code>. However, a standalone function call cannot be followed by an open brace <code>{</code> (at the end of the line or on the next line), because it would be confused with a function declaration.</p>
<p>Method calls such as <code>MyObj.MyMethod()</code>.</p>
<p>Member access using square brackets, such as <code>MyObj[Index]</code>, which can have side-effects like a function call.</p>
<p>Ternary expressions such as <code>x ? CallIfTrue() : CallIfFalse()</code>. However, it is safer to utilize the rule below; that is, always enclose the expression (or just the condition) in parentheses.</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Known limitation:</strong> Due to ambiguity with <a href="#function-call-statements">function call statements</a>, conditions beginning with a variable name and space (but also containing other operators) should be enclosed in parentheses. For example, <code>(x + 1) ? y : z</code> and <code>x+1 ? y : z </code> are expression statements but <code>x + 1 ? y : z</code> is a function call statement.</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> The condition cannot begin with <code>!</code> or any other expression operator, as it would be interpreted as a <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation-line">continuation line</a>.</p>
<p>Expressions starting with <code>(</code>. However, there usually must be a matching <code>)</code> on the same line, otherwise the line would be interpreted as the start of a <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation">continuation section</a>.</p>
<p>Expressions starting with a double-deref, such as <code>%varname% := 1</code>. This is primarily due to implementation complexity.</p>
<p>Expressions that start with any of those described above (but not those described below) are also allowed, for simplicity. For example, <code>MyFunc()+1</code> is currently allowed, although the <code>+1</code> has no effect and its result is discarded. Such expressions might become invalid in the future due to enhanced error-checking.</p>
<p><a href="#function-call-statements">Function call statements</a> are similar to expression statements, but are technically not pure expressions. For example, <code>MsgBox "Hello, world!"</code>, <code>myGui.Show</code> or <code>x.y.z "my parameter"</code>.</p>

<h2 id="control-flow">Control Flow Statements</h2>
<p class="note">For a general explanation of control flow, see <a href="Concepts.htm#control-flow">Control Flow</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Concepts.htm#statement">Statements</a> are grouped together into a <a href="lib/Block.htm"><em>block</em></a> by enclosing them in braces <code>{}</code>, as in C, JavaScript and similar languages, but usually the braces must appear at the start of a line. Control flow statements can be applied to an entire block or just a single statement.</p>
<p>The <a href="Concepts.htm#cf-body">body</a> of a control flow statement is always a single <em>group</em> of statements. A block counts as a single group of statements, as does a control flow statement and its body. The following related statements are also grouped with each other, along with their bodies: <code>If</code> with <code>Else</code>; <code>Loop</code>/<code>For</code> with <code>Until</code> or <code>Else</code>; <code>Try</code> with <code>Catch</code> and/or <code>Else</code> and/or <code>Finally</code>. In other words, when a group of these statements is used as a whole, it does not always need to be enclosed in braces (however, some coding styles always include the braces, for clarity).</p>
<p>Control flow statements which have a body and therefore must always be followed by a related statement or group of statements: <code>If</code>, <code>Else</code>, <code>Loop</code>, <code>While</code>, <code>For</code>, <code>Try</code>, <code>Catch</code> and <code>Finally</code>.</p>
<p id="control-flow-list">The following control flow statements exist:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="lib/Block.htm">block</a> (denoted by a pair of braces) groups zero or more statements to act as a single statement.</li>
  <li>An <a href="lib/If.htm">If statement</a> causes its body to be executed or not depending on a condition. It can be followed by an <a href="lib/Else.htm">Else</a> statement, which executes only if the condition was not met.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/Goto.htm">Goto</a> jumps to the specified label and continues execution.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/Return.htm">Return</a> returns from a function.</li>
  <li>A <a href="#loop-statement">Loop statement</a> (<a href="lib/Loop.htm">Loop</a>, <a href="lib/While.htm">While</a> or <a href="lib/For.htm">For</a>) executes its body repeatedly.
  <ul>
    <li><a href="lib/Break.htm">Break</a> exits (terminates) a loop.</li>
    <li><a href="lib/Continue.htm">Continue</a> skips the rest of the current loop iteration and begins a new one.</li>
    <li><a href="lib/Until.htm">Until</a> causes a loop to terminate when an expression evaluates to true. The expression is evaluated after each iteration.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><a href="lib/Switch.htm">Switch</a> executes one case from a list of mutually exclusive candidates.</li>
  <li>Exception handling:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="lib/Try.htm">Try</a> guards its body against runtime errors and values thrown by the throw statement.</li>
    <li><a href="lib/Catch.htm">Catch</a> executes if an exception of a given type is thrown within a try statement.</li>
    <li><a href="lib/Else.htm">Else</a>, when used after a catch statement, executes only if no exception is thrown within a try statement.</li>
    <li><a href="lib/Finally.htm">Finally</a> executes its body when control is being transferred out of a try or catch statement's body.</li>
    <li><a href="lib/Throw.htm">Throw</a> throws an exception to be handled by try/catch or <a href="lib/OnError.htm">OnError</a>, or to display an error dialog.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="control-flow-vs">Control Flow vs. Other Statements</h3>
<p>Control flow statements differ from <a href="#function-call-statements">function call statements</a> in several ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The opening brace of a <a href="lib/Block.htm">block</a> can be written at the end of the same line as an <a href="lib/If.htm">If</a>, <a href="lib/Else.htm">Else</a>, <a href="#loop-statement">Loop</a>, <a href="lib/While.htm">While</a>, <a href="lib/For.htm">For</a>, <a href="lib/Try.htm">Try</a>, <a href="lib/Catch.htm">Catch</a> or <a href="lib/Finally.htm">Finally</a> statement (basically any control flow statement which has a <a href="Concepts.htm#cf-body">body</a>). This is referred to as the One True Brace (OTB) style.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/Else.htm">Else</a>, <a href="lib/Try.htm">Try</a> and <a href="lib/Finally.htm">Finally</a> allow any valid statement to their right, as they require a <a href="Concepts.htm#cf-body">body</a> but have no parameters.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/If.htm">If</a>, <a href="lib/While.htm">While</a>, <a href="lib/Return.htm">Return</a>, <a href="lib/Until.htm">Until</a>, <a href="lib/Loop.htm">Loop <em>Count</em></a> and <a href="lib/Goto.htm">Goto</a> allow an open parenthesis to be used immediately after the name, to enclose the entire parameter list. Although these look like function calls, they are not, and cannot be used mid-expression. For example, <code>if(expression)</code>.</li>
  <li>Control flow statements cannot be overridden by defining a function with the same name.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="loop-statement">Loop Statement</h3>
<p>There are several types of loop statements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="lib/Loop.htm">Loop <em>Count</em></a> executes a statement repeatedly: either the specified number of times or until break is encountered.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/LoopReg.htm">Loop Reg</a> retrieves the contents of the specified registry subkey, one item at a time.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/LoopFiles.htm">Loop Files</a> retrieves the specified files or folders, one at a time.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/LoopParse.htm">Loop Parse</a> retrieves substrings (fields) from a string, one at a time.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/LoopRead.htm">Loop Read</a> retrieves the lines in a text file, one at a time.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/While.htm">While</a> executes a statement repeatedly until the specified expression evaluates to false. The expression is evaluated before each iteration.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/For.htm">For</a> executes a statement once for each value or pair of values returned by an enumerator, such as each key-value pair in an object.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="lib/Break.htm">Break</a> exits (terminates) a loop, effectively jumping to the next line after the loop's body.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Continue.htm">Continue</a> skips the rest of the current loop iteration and begins a new one.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Until.htm">Until</a> causes a loop to terminate when an expression evaluates to true. The expression is evaluated after each iteration.</p>
<p id="named-loops">A <a href="#labels">label</a> can be used to "name" a loop for <a href="lib/Continue.htm">Continue</a> and <a href="lib/Break.htm">Break</a>. This allows the script to easily continue or break out of any number of nested loops without using <a href="lib/Goto.htm">Goto</a>.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_Index</strong> contains the number of the current loop iteration. It contains 1 the first time the loop's body is executed. For the second time, it contains 2; and so on. If an inner loop is enclosed by an outer loop, the inner loop takes precedence. A_Index works inside all types of loops, but contains 0 outside of a loop.</p>
<p>For some loop types, other built-in variables return information about the current loop item (registry key/value, file, substring or line of text). These variables have names beginning with <strong>A_Loop</strong>, such as A_LoopFileName and A_LoopReadLine. Their values always correspond to the most recently started (but not yet stopped) loop of the appropriate type. For example, A_LoopField returns the current substring in the innermost parsing loop, even if it is used inside a file or registry loop.</p>
<pre>t := "column 1`tcolumn 2`nvalue 1`tvalue 2"
Loop Parse t, "`n"
{
    rowtext := A_LoopField
    rownum := A_Index  <em>; Save this for use in the second loop, below.</em>
    Loop Parse rowtext, "`t"
    {
        MsgBox rownum ":" A_Index " = " A_LoopField
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Loop variables can also be used outside the body of a loop, such as in a function which is called from within a loop.</p>

<h3 id="not-control-flow">Not Control Flow</h3>
<p>As directives, labels, double-colon hotkey and hotstring tags, and declarations without assignments are processed when the script is loaded from file, they are not subject to control flow. In other words, they take effect unconditionally, before the script ever executes any control flow statements. Similarly, the <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> directive cannot affect control flow; it merely sets the criteria for any hotkeys and hotstrings specified in the code. A hotkey's criteria is evaluated each time it is pressed, not when the #HotIf directive is encountered in the code.</p>

<h2 id="structure-of-a-script">Structure of a Script</h2>

<h3 id="global-code">Global Code</h3>
<p>After the script has been loaded, the <em>auto-execute thread</em> begins executing at the script's top line, and continues until instructed to stop, such as by <a href="lib/Return.htm">Return</a>, <a href="lib/ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> or <a href="lib/Exit.htm">Exit</a>. The physical end of the script also acts as <a href="lib/Exit.htm">Exit</a>.</p>
<p>Global code, or code in the global <a href="Concepts.htm#scope">scope</a>, is any executable code that is not inside a function or class definition. Any variable references there are said to be <a href="Functions.htm#Global">global</a>, since they can be accessed by any function (with the proper declaration). Such code is often used to configure settings which apply to every newly launched <a href="misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, or to <a href="Concepts.htm#uninitialized-variables">initialize</a> global variables used by hotkeys and other functions.</p>
<p>Code to be executed at startup (immediately when the script starts) is often placed at the top of the file. However, such code can be placed throughout the file, in between (but not inside) function and class definitions. This is because the body of each function or class definition is skipped whenever it is encountered during execution. In some cases, the entire purpose of the script may be carried out with global code.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="Scripts.htm#auto">Script Startup (the Auto-execute Thread)</a></p>

<h3 id="subroutines">Subroutines</h3>
<p>A <em>subroutine</em> (also <em>sub</em> or <em>procedure</em>) is a reusable block of code which can be executed on demand. A subroutine is created by defining a <em>function</em> (see below). These terms are generally interchangeable for AutoHotkey v2, where functions are the only type of subroutine.</p>

<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="Functions.htm">Functions</a> (all about defining functions)</p>
<p>Aside from calling the many useful <a href="lib/index.htm">predefined functions</a>, a script can define its own functions. These functions can generally be used two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A function can be called by the script itself. This kind of function might be used to avoid repetition, to make the code more manageable, or perhaps for other purposes.</li>
  <li>A function can be called by the program in response to some event, such as the user pressing a hotkey. For instance, each hotkey is associated with a function to execute whenever the hotkey is pressed.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are multiple ways to define a function:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="Functions.htm">function definition</a> combining a name, parentheses and a <a href="lib/Block.htm">block</a> of code. This defines a function which can be executed by name with a <a href="#function-calls">function call</a> or <a href="#function-call-statements">function call statement</a>. For example:
<pre>SayHello()  <em>; Define the SayHello function.</em>
{
    MsgBox "Hello!"
}

SayHello  <em>; Call the SayHello function.</em></pre>
  </li>
  <li>A <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> or <a href="Hotstrings.htm">hotstring</a> definition, combining a hotkey or hotstring with a single <a href="Concepts.htm#statement">statement</a> or a <a href="lib/Block.htm">block</a> of code. This type of function cannot be called directly, but is executed whenever the hotkey or hotstring is activated. For example:
<pre>#w::Run "wordpad"  <em>; Press Win-W to run Wordpad.</em>
#n::  <em>; Press Win-N to run Notepad.</em>
{
    Run "notepad"
}</pre>
  </li>
  <li>A <a href="Variables.htm#fat-arrow">fat arrow expression</a> defines a function which evaluates an <a href="#expressions">expression</a> and <a href="Concepts.htm#return-a-value">returns</a> its result, instead of executing a block of code. Such functions usually have no name as they are passed directly to another function. For example:
    <pre>SetTimer () =&gt; MsgBox("Hello!"), -1000  <em>; Says hello after 1 second.</em></pre>
  </li>
  <li>The fat arrow syntax can also be used outside of expressions as shorthand for a normal function or method definition. For example, the following is equivalent to the SayHello definition above, except that this one returns "OK":
    <pre>SayHello() =&gt; MsgBox("Hello!")</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Variables in functions are <a href="Functions.htm#Local">local</a> to that function by default, except in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the function is <a href="Functions.htm#AssumeGlobal">assume-global</a>.</li>
  <li>When a variable is referenced but not used as the target of an <a href="Variables.htm#AssignOp">assignment</a> or the reference operator (<code>&amp;var</code>).</li>
  <li>When referring to a local variable of an outer function inside a <a href="Functions.htm#nested">nested function</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A function can optionally <a href="Concepts.htm#parameters">accept parameters</a>. Parameters are defined by listing them inside the parentheses. For example:</p>
<pre>MyFunction(FirstParameter, Second, &amp;Third, Fourth:="")
{
    <em>;...</em>
    return "a value"
}
</pre>
<p>As with function calls, there must be no space between the function name and open-parenthesis.</p>
<p>The line break between the close-parenthesis and open-brace is optional. There can be any amount of whitespace or comments between the two.</p>
<p>The <a href="Functions.htm#ByRef">ByRef marker (&amp;)</a> indicates that the caller must pass a variable reference. Inside the function, any reference to the parameter will actually access the caller's variable. This is similar to omitting <code>&amp;</code> and explicitly <a href="Variables.htm#deref">dereferencing</a> the parameter inside the function (e.g. <code>%Third%</code>), but in this case the percent signs are omitted. If the parameter is optional and the caller omits it, the parameter acts as a normal local variable.</p>
<p><a href="Functions.htm#optional">Optional</a> parameters are specified by following the parameter name with <code>:=</code> and a default value, which must be a literal quoted string, a number, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> or <code>unset</code>.</p>
<p>The function can <a href="Functions.htm#return">return a value</a>. If it does not, the default return value is an empty string.</p>
<p>A function definition does not need to precede calls to that function.</p>
<p class="note">See <a href="Functions.htm">Functions</a> for much more detail.</p>

<h3 id="-include">#Include</h3>
<p>The <a href="lib/_Include.htm">#Include</a> directive causes the script to behave as though the specified file's contents are present at this exact position. This is often used to organise code into separate files, or to make use of script libraries written by other users.</p>
<p>An #Include file can contain <a href="#global-code">global code</a> to be executed during <a href="Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>, but as with code in the main script file, such code will be executed only if the auto-execute thread is not terminated (such as with an unconditional <code>Return</code>) prior to the #Include directive. A <a href="lib/_Warn.htm#Unreachable">warning</a> is displayed by default if any code cannot be executed due to a prior <code>Return</code>.</p>
<p>Unlike in C/C++, #Include does nothing if the file has already been included by a previous directive. To include the contents of the same file multiple times, use <a href="lib/_Include.htm">#IncludeAgain</a>.</p>
<p>To facilitate sharing scripts, #Include can search a few standard locations for a library script. For details, see <a href="Scripts.htm#lib">Script Library Folders</a>.</p>

<h2 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3 id="dynamic-variables">Dynamic Variables</h3>
<p>A <em>dynamic variable reference</em> takes a text value and interprets it as the name of a variable.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> A variable cannot be <em>created</em> by a dynamic reference, but existing variables can be assigned. This includes all variables which the script contains non-dynamic references to, even if they have not been assigned values.</p>
<p>The most common form of dynamic variable reference is called a <em>double reference</em> or <em>double-deref</em>. Before performing a double reference, the name of the target variable is stored in a second variable. This second variable can then be used to assign a value to the target variable indirectly, using a double reference. For example:</p>
<pre>target := 42
second := "target"
MsgBox  second   <em>; Normal (single) variable reference =&gt; target</em>
MsgBox %second%  <em>; Double-deref =&gt; 42</em>
</pre>
<p>Currently, <code>second</code> must always contain a variable name in the second case; arbitrary expressions are not supported.</p>
<p>A dynamic variable reference can also take one or more pieces of literal text and the content of one or more variables, and join them together to form a single variable name. This is done simply by writing the pieces of the name and percent-enclosed variables in sequence, without any spaces. For example, <code>MyArray%A_Index%</code> or <code>MyGrid%X%_%Y%</code>. This is used to access <em>pseudo-arrays</em>, described below.</p>
<p>These techniques can also be applied to properties and methods of objects. For example:</p>
<pre>clr := {}
for n, component in ["red", "green", "blue"]
    clr.%component% := Random(0, 255)
MsgBox clr.red "," clr.green "," clr.blue</pre>

<h4 id="pseudo-arrays">Pseudo-arrays</h4>
<p>A <em>pseudo-array</em> is actually just a bunch of discrete variables, but with a naming pattern which allows them to be used like elements of an array. For example:</p>
<pre>
MyArray1 := "A"
MyArray2 := "B"
MyArray3 := "C"
Loop 3
    MsgBox MyArray%A_Index%  <em>; Shows A, then B, then C.</em>
</pre>
<p>The "index" used to form the final variable name does not have to be numeric; it could instead be a letter or keyword.</p>
<p>For these reasons, it is generally recommended to use an <a href="Objects.htm#Usage_Simple_Arrays">Array</a> or <a href="Objects.htm#Usage_Associative_Arrays">Map</a> instead of a pseudo-array:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As the individual elements are just normal variables, one can assign or retrieve a value, but cannot <em>remove</em> or <em>insert</em> elements.</li>
  <li>Because the pseudo-array is only conceptual and not a single value, it can't be passed to or returned from a function, or copied as a whole.</li>
  <li>A pseudo-array cannot be declared as a whole, so some "elements" may resolve to <a href="Functions.htm#Global">global</a> (or <a href="Functions.htm#capture-var">captured</a>) variables while others do not.</li>
  <li>If a variable is referenced non-dynamically but only assigned dynamically, a <a href="lib/_Warn.htm#VarUnset">load-time warning</a> may be displayed. Such warnings are a very effective way to detect errors, so disabling them is not recommended.</li>
  <li>Current versions of the language do not permit creating new variables dynamically. This is partly to encourage best practices, and partly to avoid inconsistency between dynamic and non-dynamic variable references in functions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="labels">Labels</h3>
<p>A label identifies a line of code, and can be used as a <a href="lib/Goto.htm">Goto</a> target or to <a href="#named-loops">specify a loop</a> to break out of or continue. A label consist of a <a href="Concepts.htm#names">name</a> followed by a colon:</p>
<pre>this_is_a_label:</pre>
<p>Aside from whitespace and comments, no other code can be written on the same line as a label. For more details, see <a href="misc/Labels.htm">Labels</a>.</p>

<h1>Software License</h1>
<h2 id="GNU_GENERAL_PUBLIC_LICENSE">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>
<p>Version 2, June 1991</p>
<pre>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>
<h2 id="terms">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h2>
<p id="section0"><strong>0.</strong> This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<p id="section1"><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<p id="section2"><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd><strong>a)</strong> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><strong>b)</strong> You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><strong>c)</strong> If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p>
<p id="section3"><strong>3.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>

<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, --> 
<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->

<dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd><strong>a)</strong> Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><strong>b)</strong> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><strong>c)</strong> Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p id="section4"><strong>4.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p id="section5"><strong>5.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>
<p id="section6"><strong>6.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>
<p id="section7"><strong>7.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p id="section8"><strong>8.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
<p id="section9"><strong>9.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p id="section10"><strong>10.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p id="section11"><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p id="section12"><strong>12.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p>See <a href="ObjList.htm">Built-in Classes</a> for a list of standard object types. There are two fundamental types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AutoHotkey objects</strong> are instances of the <a href="lib/Object.htm">Object</a> class. These support ad hoc properties, and have methods for discovering which properties exist. <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a>, <a href="lib/Map.htm">Map</a> and all user defined and built-in classes are derived from Object.</li>
  <li><strong>COM objects</strong> such as those created by <a href="lib/ComObject.htm">ComObject</a>. These are implemented by external libraries, so often differ in behaviour to AutoHotkey objects. ComObject typically represents a COM or "Automation" object implementing the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch interface</a>, but is also used to <a href="lib/ComValue.htm">wrap values of specific types</a> to be passed to COM objects and functions.</li>

<h3 id="Usage_Simple_Arrays">Arrays</h3>
<p>Create an <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a>:</p>
<pre>MyArray := [Item1, Item2, ..., ItemN]
MyArray := Array(Item1, Item2, ..., ItemN)</pre>
<p>Retrieve an item (or <em>array element</em>):</p>
<pre>Value := MyArray[Index]</pre>
<p>Change the value of an item (<code>Index</code> must be between 1 and Length, or an equivalent reverse index):</p>
<pre>MyArray[Index] := Value</pre>
<p>Insert one or more items at a given index using the <a href="lib/Array.htm#InsertAt">InsertAt</a> method:</p>
<pre>MyArray.InsertAt(Index, Value, Value2, ...)</pre>
<p>Append one or more items using the <a href="lib/Array.htm#Push">Push</a> method:</p>
<pre>MyArray.Push(Value, Value2, ...)</pre>
<p>Remove an item using the <a href="lib/Array.htm#RemoveAt">RemoveAt</a> method:</p>
<pre>RemovedValue := MyArray.RemoveAt(Index)</pre>
<p>Remove the last item using the <a href="lib/Array.htm#Pop">Pop</a> method:</p>
<pre>RemovedValue := MyArray.Pop()</pre>
<p><a href="lib/Array.htm#Length">Length</a> returns the number of items in the array. Looping through an array's contents can be done either by index or with a For-loop. For example:</p>
<pre>MyArray := ["one", "two", "three"]

<em>; Iterate from 1 to the end of the array:</em>
Loop MyArray.Length
    MsgBox MyArray[A_Index]

<em>; Enumerate the array's contents:</em>
For index, value in MyArray
    MsgBox "Item " index " is '" value "'"
    
<em>; Same thing again:</em>
For value in MyArray
    MsgBox "Item " A_Index " is '" value "'"
</pre>

<h3 id="Usage_Associative_Arrays">Maps (Associative Arrays)</h3>
<p>A <a href="lib/Map.htm">Map</a> or associative array is an object which contains a collection of unique keys and a collection of values, where each key is associated with one value. Keys can be strings, integers or objects, while values can be of any type. An associative array can be created as follows:</p>
<pre>MyMap := Map("KeyA", ValueA, "KeyB", ValueB, ..., "KeyZ", ValueZ)</pre>
<p>Retrieve an item, where <code>Key</code> is a <a href="Concepts.htm#variables">variable</a> or <a href="Language.htm#expressions">expression</a>:</p>
<pre>Value := MyMap[Key]</pre>
<p>Assign an item:</p>
<pre>MyMap[Key] := Value</pre>
<p>Remove an item using the <a href="lib/Array.htm#Delete">Delete</a> method:</p>
<pre>RemovedValue := MyMap.Delete(Key)</pre>
<p>Enumerating items:</p>
<pre>MyMap := Map("ten", 10, "twenty", 20, "thirty", 30)
<a href="lib/For.htm">For</a> key, value in MyMap
    MsgBox key ' = ' value</pre>

<h3 id="Usage_Objects">Objects</h3>
<p>An object can have <em>properties</em> and <em>items</em> (such as array elements). Items are accessed using <code>[]</code> as shown in the previous sections. Properties are usually accessed by writing a dot followed by an identifier (just a <a href="Concepts.htm#names">name</a>). <em>Methods</em> are properties which can be called.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>Retrieve or set a property literally named <em>Property</em>:</p>
<pre>Value := MyObject.Property</pre>
<pre>MyObject.Property := Value</pre>
<p>Retrieve or set a property where the name is determined by evaluating an <a href="Language.htm#expressions">expression</a> or <a href="Concepts.htm#variables">variable</a>:</p>
<pre>Value := MyObject.%Expression%</pre>
<pre>MyObject.%Expression% := Value</pre>
<p>Call a property/method literally named <em>Method</em>:</p>
<pre>ReturnValue := MyObject.Method(Parameters)</pre>
<p>Call a property/method where the name is determined by evaluating an expression or variable:</p>
<pre>ReturnValue := MyObject.%Expression%(Parameters)</pre>
<p>Sometimes parameters are accepted when retrieving or assigning properties:</p>
<pre>Value := MyObject.Property[Parameters]
MyObject.Property[Parameters] := Value</pre>
<p>An object may also support indexing: <code>MyArray[Index]</code> actually invokes the <a href="#__Item">__Item</a> property of <code>MyArray</code>, passing <code>Index</code> as a parameter.</p>

<h3 id="object-literal">Object Literal</h3>
<p>An object literal can be used within an <a href="Language.htm#expressions">expression</a> to create an improvised object. An object literal consists of a pair of braces (<code>{}</code>) enclosing a list of comma-delimited name-value pairs. Each pair consists of a literal (unquoted) <a href="Concepts.htm#names">property name</a> and a value (sub-expression) separated by a colon (<code>:</code>).  For example:</p>
<pre>Coord := {X: 13, Y: 240}</pre>
<p>This is equivalent:</p>
<pre>Coord := Object()
Coord.X := 13
Coord.Y := 240</pre>
<p>Each name-value pair causes a value property to be defined, with the exception that <a href="lib/Object.htm#Base">Base</a> can be set (with the same restrictions as a normal assignment).</p>
<p><a href="Variables.htm#deref">Name substitution</a> allows a property name to be determined by evaluating an <a href="Language.htm#expressions">expression</a> or <a href="Concepts.htm#variables">variable</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>parts := StrSplit("key = value", "=", " ")

<h3 id="Usage_Freeing_Objects">Freeing Objects</h3>
<p>Scripts do not free objects explicitly. When the last reference to an object is released, the object is freed automatically. A reference stored in a variable is released automatically when that variable is assigned some other value. For example:</p>
<pre>obj := {}  <em>; Creates an object.</em>
obj := ""  <em>; Releases the last reference, and therefore frees the object.</em></pre>
<p>Similarly, a reference stored in a property or array element is released when that property or array element is assigned some other value or removed from the object.</p>
<pre>arr := [{}]  <em>; Creates an array containing an object.</em>
arr[1] := {}  <em>; Creates a second object, implicitly freeing the first object.</em>
arr.RemoveAt(1)  <em>; Removes and frees the second object.</em></pre>
<p id="Circular_References">Because all references to an object must be released before the object can be freed, objects containing circular references aren't freed automatically. For instance, if <code>x.child</code> refers to <code>y</code> and <code>y.parent</code> refers to <code>x</code>, clearing <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is not sufficient since the parent object still contains a reference to the child and vice versa. To resolve this situation, remove the circular reference.</p>
<pre>
x := {}, y := {}             <em>; Create two objects.</em>
x.child := y, y.parent := x  <em>; Create a circular reference.</em>

y.parent := ""               <em>; The circular reference must be removed before the objects can be freed.</em>
x := "", y := ""             <em>; Without the above line, this would not free the objects.</em>

<p>Although "multi-dimensional" arrays are not supported, a script can combine multiple arrays or maps. For example:</p>

MsgBox grid[1][3] <em>; 3</em>

</pre>
<p id="Array2D">A custom object can implement multi-dimensional support by defining an <a href="#__Item">__Item</a> property. For example:</p>

<h2 id="Custom_Objects">Custom Objects</h2>
<p>There are two general ways to create custom objects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Ad hoc</em>: create an object and add properties.</li>
  <li><em>Delegation</em>: define properties in a shared <em>base object</em> or class.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#Meta_Functions">Meta-functions</a> can be used to further control how an object behaves.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Within this section, an <em>object</em> is any instance of the <a href="lib/Object.htm">Object</a> class. This section does not apply to COM objects.</p>

<h3 id="ad-hoc">Ad Hoc</h3>
<p>Properties and methods (callable properties) can generally be added to new objects at any time. For example, an object with one property and one method might be constructed like this:</p>
<pre><em>; Create an object.</em>
thing := {}
<em>; Store a value.</em>
thing.foo := "bar"
<em>; Define a method.</em>
thing.test := thing_test
<em>; Call the method.</em>
thing.test()

thing_test(this) {
    MsgBox this.foo
}</pre>
<p>You could similarly create the above object with <code>thing := {foo: "bar"}</code>. When using the {property:value} notation, quote marks must not be used for properties.</p>
<p>When <code>thing.test()</code> is called, <i>thing</i> is automatically inserted at the beginning of the parameter list. By convention, the function is named by combining the "type" of object and the method name, but this is not a requirement.</p>
<p>In the example above, <em>test</em> could be assigned some other function or value after it is defined, in which case the original function is lost and cannot be called via this property. An alternative is to define a read-only method, as shown below:</p>
<pre>thing.DefineProp 'test', {call: thing_test}</pre>
<p>See also: <a href="lib/Object.htm#DefineProp">DefineProp</a></p>

<h3 id="delegation">Delegation</h3>
<p>Objects are <em>prototype-based</em>. That is, any properties not defined in the object itself can instead be defined in the object's <a href="lib/Object.htm#Base">base</a>. This is known as <em>inheritance by delegation</em> or <em>differential inheritance</em>, because an object can implement only the parts that make it different, while delegating the rest to its base.</p>
<p>Although a base object is also generally known as a prototype, we use "a class's <a href="lib/Class.htm#Prototype">Prototype</a>" to mean the object upon which every instance of the class is based, and "base" to mean the object upon which an instance is based.</p>
<p class="note">AutoHotkey's object design was influenced primarily by JavaScript and Lua, with a little C#. We use <code><i>obj</i>.base</code> in place of JavaScript's <code><i>obj</i>.__proto__</code> and <code><i>cls</i>.Prototype</code> in place of JavaScript's <code><i>func</i>.prototype</code>. (Class objects are used in place of constructor functions.)</p>

<p>An object's base is also used to identify its type or class. For example, <code>x := []</code> creates an object <em>based on</em> <code>Array.Prototype</code>, which means that the expressions <code>x is Array</code> and <code>x.HasBase(Array.Prototype)</code> are true, and <code>type(x)</code> returns "Array". Each class's Prototype is based on the Prototype of its base class, so <code>x.HasBase(Object.Prototype)</code> is also true.</p>
<p>Any instance of Object or a derived class can be a base object, but an object can only be <a href="lib/Object.htm#Base">assigned as the base</a> of an object with the same native type. This is to ensure that built-in methods can always identify the native type of an object, and operate only on objects that have the correct binary structure.</p>
<p>Base objects can be defined two different ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By <a href="#creating-a-base-object">creating a normal object</a>.</li>
  <li>By <a href="#Custom_Classes">defining a class</a>. Each class has a <a href="lib/Class.htm#Prototype">Prototype</a> property containing an object which all instances of that class are based on, while the class itself becomes the base object of any direct subclasses.</li>
</ul>
<p>A base object can be assigned to the <a href="lib/Object.htm#Base">base</a> property of another object, but typically an object's base is set implicitly when it is created.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-base-object">Creating a Base Object</h3>
<p>Any object can be used as the base of any other object which has the same native type. The following example builds on the previous example under <a href="#ad-hoc">Ad Hoc</a> (combine the two before running it):</p>
<pre>other := {}
other.base := thing
other.test()</pre>
<p>In this case, <i>other</i> inherits <i>foo</i> and <i>test</i> from <i>thing</i>. This inheritance is dynamic, so if <code>thing.foo</code> is modified, the change will be reflected by <code>other.foo</code>. If the script assigns to <code>other.foo</code>, the value is stored in <i>other</i> and any further changes to <code>thing.foo</code> will have no effect on <code>other.foo</code>. When <code>other.test()</code> is called, its <i>this</i> parameter contains a reference to <i>other</i> instead of <i>thing</i>.</p>

<h3 id="Custom_Classes">Classes</h3>
<blockquote>In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)" class="source">Wikipedia</a></blockquote>
<p>In more general terms, a <em>class</em> is a set or category of things having some property or attribute in common. In AutoHotkey, a <code>class</code> defines properties to be shared by instances of the class (and methods, which are callable properties). An <em>instance</em> is just an object which inherits properties from the class, and can typically also be identified as belonging to that class (such as with the expression <code><i>instance</i> is <i>ClassName</i></code>). Instances are typically created by calling <a href="lib/Class.htm#Call"><em>ClassName</em>()</a>.</p>
<p>Since <a href="lib/Object.htm">Objects</a> are <a href="#ad-hoc">dynamic</a> and <a href="#delegation">prototype-based</a>, each class consists of two parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The class has a <a href="lib/Class.htm#Prototype">Prototype</a> object, on which all instances of the class are based. All methods and dynamic properties that apply to instances of the class are contained by the prototype object. This includes all properties and methods which lack the <code>static</code> keyword.</li>
  <li>The class itself is an object, containing only static methods and properties. This includes all properties and methods with the <code>static</code> keyword, and all nested classes. These do not apply to a specific instance, and can be used by referring to the class itself by name.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following shows most of the elements of a class definition:</p>
<pre>class ClassName extends BaseClassName
{
    InstanceVar := <i>Expression</i>
    
    static ClassVar := <i>Expression</i>

    class NestedClass
    {
        ...
    }

    Method()
    {
        ...
    }
    
    static Method()
    {
        ...
    }

    Property[<i>Parameters</i>]  <em>; Use brackets only when parameters are present.</em>
    {
        <span class="dec">get</span> {
            return <i>value of property</i>
        }
        <span class="dec">set</span> {
            <i>Store or otherwise handle</i> <span class="biv">value</span>
        }
    }
    
    ShortProperty
    {
        <span class="dec">get</span> =&gt; <i>Expression which calculates property value</i>
        <span class="dec">set</span> =&gt; <i>Expression which stores or otherwise handles</i> <span class="biv">value</span>
    }
    
    ShorterProperty =&gt; <i>Expression which calculates property value</i>
}
</pre>
<p>When the script is loaded, this constructs a <a href="lib/Class.htm">Class</a> object and stores it in a <a href="Functions.htm#Global">global</a> constant (read-only variable) with the name <i>ClassName</i>. If <code>extends BaseClassName</code> is present, <i>BaseClassName</i> must be the full name of another class. The full name of each class is stored in <code><i>ClassName</i>.Prototype.__Class</code>.</p>
<p>Because the class itself is accessed through a variable, the class name cannot be used to both reference the class and create a separate variable (such as to hold an instance of the class) in the same context. For example, <code>box := Box()</code> will not work, because <code>box</code> and <code>Box</code> both resolve to the same thing. Attempting to reassign a top-level (not nested) class in this manner results in a load time error.</p>
<p>Within this documentation, the word "class" on its own usually means a class object constructed with the <code>class</code> keyword.</p>
<p>Class definitions can contain variable declarations, method definitions and nested class definitions.</p>

<h4 id="Custom_Classes_var">Instance Variables</h4>
<p>An <em>instance variable</em> is one that each instance of the class has its own copy of. They are declared and behave like normal assignments, but the <code>this.</code> prefix is omitted (only directly within the class body):</p>
<pre>InstanceVar := Expression</pre>
<p>These declarations are evaluated each time a new instance of the class is created with <a href="lib/Class.htm#Call"><em>ClassName</em>()</a>, after all base-class declarations are evaluated but before <a href="#Custom_NewDelete">__New</a> is called. This is achieved by automatically creating a method named <em>__Init</em> containing a call to <code>super.__Init()</code> and inserting each declaration into it. Therefore, a single class definition must not contain both an __Init method and an instance variable declaration.</p>
<p><em>Expression</em> can access other instance variables and methods via <code>this</code>. Global variables may be read, but not assigned. An additional assignment (or use of the <a href="Variables.htm#ref">reference operator</a>) within the expression will generally create a variable local to the __Init method. For example, <code>x := y := 1</code> would set <code>this.x</code> and a local variable <code>y</code> (which would be freed once all initializers have been evaluated).</p>
<p>To access an instance variable (even within a method), always specify the target object; for example, <code><b>this</b>.InstanceVar</code>.</p>
<p>Declarations like <code>x.y := z</code> are also supported, provided that <code>x</code> was previously defined in this class. For example, <code>x := {}, x.y := 42</code> declares <code>x</code> and also initializes <code>this.x.y</code>.</p>

<h4 id="Custom_Classes_staticvar">Static/Class Variables</h4>
<p>Static/class variables belong to the class itself, but their values can be inherited by subclasses. They are declared like instance variables, but using the static keyword:</p>
<pre>static ClassVar := Expression</pre>
<p>These declarations are evaluated only once, when the class is <a href="#static__New">initialized</a>. A static method named <em>__Init</em> is automatically defined for this purpose.</p>
<p>Each declaration acts as a normal property assignment, with the class object as the target. <em>Expression</em> has the same interpretation as for instance variables, except that <code>this</code> refers to the class itself.</p>
<p>To assign to a class variable anywhere else, always specify the class object; for example, <code><b>ClassName</b>.ClassVar := Value</code>. If a subclass does not own a property by that name, <code><i>Subclass</i>.ClassVar</code> can also be used to retrieve the value; so if the value is a reference to an object, subclasses will share that object by default. However, <code><i>Subclass</i>.ClassVar := y</code> would store the value in <em>Subclass</em>, not in <em>ClassName</em>.</p>
<p>Declarations like <code>static x.y := z</code> are also supported, provided that <code>x</code> was previously defined in this class. For example, <code>static x := {}, x.y := 42</code> declares <code>x</code> and also initializes <code><i>ClassName</i>.x.y</code>.  Because <a href="lib/Class.htm#Prototype">Prototype</a> is implicitly defined in each class, <code>static Prototype.sharedValue := 1</code> can be used to set values which are dynamically inherited by all instances of the class (until shadowed by a property on the instance itself).</p>

<h4 id="Custom_Classes_class">Nested Classes</h4>
<p>Nested class definitions allow a class object to be associated with a static/class variable of the outer class instead of a separate global variable. In the example above, <code>class NestedClass</code> constructs a <a href="lib/Class.htm">Class</a> object and stores it in <code>ClassName.NestedClass</code>. Subclasses could inherit <em>NestedClass</em> or override it with their own nested class (in which case <code>(<i>WhichClass</i>.NestedClass)()</code> could be used to instantiate whichever class is appropriate).</p>
<pre>
class NestedClass
{
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>Nesting a class does not imply any particular relationship to the outer class. The nested class is not instantiated automatically, nor do instances of the nested class have any connection with an instance of the outer class, unless the script explicitly makes that connection.</p>
<p>However, due to the way methods work for <a href="lib/Object.htm">Objects</a>, <code><i>WhichClass</i>.NestedClass()</code> implicitly passes <em>WhichClass</em> as the first parameter, equivalent to <code><i>WhichClass</i>.NestedClass.Call(<i>WhichClass</i>)</code>. Unless <code>static Call()</code> is overridden, this parameter is automatically passed to <a href="#Custom_NewDelete">__New</a>.</p>

<h4 id="Custom_Classes_method">Methods</h4>
<p>Method definitions look identical to function definitions. Each method definition creates a <a href="lib/Func.htm">Func</a> with a hidden first parameter named <code>this</code>, and defines a property which is used to call the method or retrieve its function object.</p>
<p>There are two types of methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Instance methods are defined as below, and are attached to the class's <a href="lib/Class.htm#Prototype">Prototype</a>, which makes them accessible via any instance of the class. When the method is called, <code>this</code> refers to an instance of the class.</li>
  <li>Static methods are defined by preceding the method name with the separate keyword <code>static</code>. These are attached to the class object itself, but are also inherited by subclasses, so <code>this</code> refers to either the class itself or a subclass.</li>
</ul>
<p>The method definition below creates a property of the same type as <code><i>target</i>.DefineProp('Method', {call: <i>funcObj</i>})</code>. By default, <code><i>target</i>.Method</code> returns <em>funcObj</em> and attempting to assign to <code><i>target</i>.Method</code> throws an error. These defaults can be overridden by <a href="#Custom_Classes_property">defining a property</a> or calling <a href="lib/Object.htm#DefineProp">DefineProp</a>.</p>
<pre>
Method()
{
    ...
}
</pre>

<p><a href="Variables.htm#fat-arrow">Fat arrow syntax</a> can be used to define a single-line method which returns an expression:</p>
<pre>Method() =&gt; <i>Expression</i></pre>

<h4 id="Custom_Classes_super">Super</h4>
<p>Inside a method or a property getter/setter, the keyword <code>super</code> can be used in place of <code>this</code> to access the superclass versions of methods or properties which are overridden in a derived class. For example, <code>super.Method()</code> in the class defined above would typically call the version of <em>Method</em> which was defined within <em>BaseClassName</em>. Note:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>super.Method()</code> always invokes the base of the class or prototype object associated with the current method's original definition, even if <code>this</code> is derived from a <em>subclass</em> of that class or some other class entirely.</li>
  <li><code>super.Method()</code> implicitly passes <code>this</code> as the first (hidden) parameter.</li>
  <li>Since it is not known where (or whether) <em>ClassName</em> exists within the chain of base objects, <em>ClassName</em> itself is used as the starting point. Therefore, <code>super.Method()</code> is mostly equivalent to <code>(<i>ClassName</i>.Prototype.base.Method)(this)</code> (but without <em>Prototype</em> when <em>Method</em> is static). However, <code><i>ClassName</i>.Prototype</code> is resolved at load time.</li>
  <li>An error is thrown if the property is not defined in a superclass or cannot be invoked.</li>
</ul>
<p>The keyword <code>super</code> must be followed by one of the following symbols: <code>.[(</code></p>
<p><code>super()</code> is equivalent to <code>super.call()</code>.</p>

<h4 id="Custom_Classes_property">Properties</h4>
<p>A property definition creates a <a href="lib/Object.htm#DefineProp">dynamic property</a>, which calls a method instead of simply storing or returning a value.</p>
<pre>Property[<i>Parameters</i>]
{
    <span class="dec">get</span> {
        return <i>property value</i>
    }
    <span class="dec">set</span> {
        <i>Store or otherwise handle</i> <span class="biv">value</span>
    }
}
</pre>
<p><em>Property</em> is simply the name of the property, which will be used to invoke it. For example, <code>obj.Property</code> would call <em>get</em> while <code>obj.Property := value</code> would call <em>set</em>. Within <em>get</em> or <em>set</em>, <code>this</code> refers to the object being invoked. Within <em>set</em>, <code>value</code> contains the value being assigned.</p>
<p>Parameters can be defined by enclosing them in square brackets to the right of the property name, and are passed the same way - but they should be omitted when parameters are not present (see below). Aside from using square brackets, parameters of properties are defined the same way as parameters of methods - optional, ByRef and variadic parameters are supported.</p>
<p>If a property is invoked with parameters but has none defined, parameters are automatically forwarded to the <a href="#__Item">__Item</a> property of the object returned by <em>get</em>. For example, <code>this.Property[x]</code> would have the same effect as <code>(this.Property)[x]</code> or <code>y := this.Property, y[x]</code>. Empty brackets (<code>this.Property[]</code>) always cause the __Item property <em>of Property's value</em> to be invoked, but a variadic call such as <code>this.Property[args*]</code> has this effect only if the number of parameters is non-zero.</p>
<p>Static properties can be defined by preceding the property name with the separate keyword <code>static</code>. In that case, <code>this</code> refers to the class itself or a subclass.</p>
<p>The return value of <em>set</em> is ignored. For example, <code>val := obj.Property := 42</code> always assigns <code>val := 42</code> regardless of what the property does, unless it throws an exception or exits the thread.</p>
<p>Each class can define one or both halves of a property. If a class overrides a property, it can use <code><a href="#Custom_Classes_super">super.Property</a></code> to access the property defined by its base class. If <em>Get</em> or <em>Set</em> is not defined, it can be inherited from a base object. If <em>Get</em> is undefined, the property can return a value inherited from a base. If <em>Set</em> is undefined in this and all base objects (or is obscured by an inherited value property), attempting to set the property causes an exception to be thrown.</p>
<p>A property definition with both <em>get</em> and <em>set</em> actually creates two separate functions, which do not share local or static variables or nested functions. As with methods, each function has a hidden parameter named <code>this</code>, and <em>set</em> has a second hidden parameter named <code>value</code>. Any explicitly defined parameters come after those.</p>
<p>While a property definition defines the <em>get</em> and <em>set</em> accessor functions for a property in the same way as <a href="lib/Object.htm#DefineProp">DefineProp</a>, a method definition defines the <em>call</em> accessor function. Any class may contain a property definition and a method definition with the same name. If a property without a <em>call</em> accessor function (a method) is called, <em>get</em> is invoked with no parameters and the result is then called as a method.</p>

<h4 id="Custom_Classes_property_short">Fat Arrow Properties</h4>
<p><a href="Variables.htm#fat-arrow">Fat arrow syntax</a> can be used to define a <a href="#Custom_Classes_property">property</a> getter or setter which returns an expression:</p>
<pre>ShortProperty[<i>Parameters</i>]
{
    <span class="dec">get</span> =&gt; <i>Expression which calculates property value</i>
    <span class="dec">set</span> =&gt; <i>Expression which stores or otherwise handles</i> <span class="biv">value</span>
}</pre>
<p>When defining only a getter, the braces and <code>get</code> can be omitted:</p>
<pre>ShorterProperty[<i>Parameters</i>] =&gt; <i>Expression which calculates property value</i></pre>
<p>In both cases, the square brackets must be omitted unless parameters are defined.</p>

<h3 id="__Enum">__Enum Method</h3>
<pre class="Syntax">__Enum(NumberOfVars)</pre>
<p>The __Enum method is called when the object is passed to a <a href="lib/For.htm">for-loop</a>. This method should return an <a href="lib/Enumerator.htm">enumerator</a> which will return items contained by the object, such as array elements. If left undefined, the object cannot be passed directly to a for-loop unless it has an <a href="lib/Enumerator.htm#Call">enumerator-compatible Call method</a>.</p>
<p><em>NumberOfVars</em> contains the number of variables passed to the for-loop. If <em>NumberOfVars</em> is 2, the enumerator is expected to assign the key or index of an item to the first parameter and the value to the second parameter. Each key or index should be accepted as a parameter of the <a href="#__Item">__Item</a> property. This enables <a href="AHKL_DBGPClients.htm">DBGp-based debuggers</a> to get or set a specific item after listing them by invoking the enumerator.</p>

<h3 id="__Item">__Item Property</h3>
<p>The __Item property is invoked when the indexing operator (array syntax) is used with the object. In the following example, the property is declared as static so that the indexing operator can be used on the Env class itself. For another example, see <a href="#Array2D">Array2D</a>.</p>
<pre>class Env {
    static __Item[name] {
        get =&gt; EnvGet(name)
        set =&gt; EnvSet(name, value)
    }
}

Env["PATH"] .= ";" A_ScriptDir  <em>; Only affects this script and child processes.</em>
MsgBox Env["PATH"]</pre>
<p><code>__Item</code> is effectively a default property name (if such a property has been defined):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code><i>object</i>[<i>params</i>]</code> is equivalent to <code><i>object</i>.__Item[<i>params</i>]</code> when there are parameters.</li>
  <li><code><i>object</i>[]</code> is equivalent to <code><i>object</i>.__Item</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
obj := {}
obj[] := Map()     <em>; Equivalent to obj.__Item := Map()</em>
obj["base"] := 10
MsgBox obj.base = Object.prototype  <em>; True</em>
MsgBox obj["base"]                  <em>; 10</em>
</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When an explicit property name is combined with empty brackets, as in <code>obj.prop[]</code>, it is handled as two separate operations: first retrieve <code>obj.prop</code>, then invoke the default property of the result. This is part of the language syntax, so is not dependent on the object.</p>

<h3 id="Custom_NewDelete">Construction and Destruction</h3>
<p>Whenever an object is created by the default implementation of <a href="lib/Class.htm#Call"><em>ClassName</em>()</a>, the new object's <code>__New</code> method is called in order to allow custom initialization. Any parameters passed to <code><i>ClassName</i>()</code> are forwarded to <code>__New</code>, so can affect the object's initial content or how it is constructed. When an object is destroyed, <code>__Delete</code> is called. For example:</p>
<pre>m1 := GMem(0, 10)
m2 := {base: GMem.Prototype}, m2.__New(0, 30)

<em>; Note: For general memory allocations, use <a href="lib/Buffer.htm">Buffer</a>() instead.</em>
class GMem<span id="GMem"></span>
{
    __New(aFlags, aSize)
    {
        this.ptr := DllCall("GlobalAlloc", "UInt", aFlags, "Ptr", aSize, "Ptr")
        if !this.ptr
            throw MemoryError()
        MsgBox "New GMem of " aSize " bytes at address " this.ptr "."
    }

    __Delete()
    {
        MsgBox "Delete GMem at address " this.ptr "."
        DllCall("GlobalFree", "Ptr", this.ptr)
    }
}</pre>
<p>__Delete is not called for any object which owns a property named "__Class". <a href="lib/Class.htm#Prototype">Prototype objects</a> have this property by default.</p>
<p>If an exception or runtime error is thrown while __Delete is executing and is not handled within __Delete, it acts as though __Delete was called from a new <a href="misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>. That is, an error dialog is displayed and __Delete returns, but the thread does not exit (unless it was already exiting).</p>
<p>If the script is directly terminated by any means, including the tray menu or <a href="lib/ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a>, any functions which have yet to return do not get the chance to do so. Therefore, any objects referenced by local variables of those functions are not released, so __Delete is not called.</p>
<p>When the script exits, objects contained by global and static variables are released automatically in an arbitrary, implementation-defined order. When __Delete is called during this process, some global or static variables may have already been released, but any references contained by the object itself are still valid. It is therefore best for __Delete to be entirely self-contained, and not rely on any global or static variables.</p>

<h4 id="static__New">Class Initialization</h4>
<p>Each class is initialized automatically when a reference to the class is evaluated for the first time. For example, if <em>MyClass</em> has not yet been initialized, <code>MyClass.MyProp</code> would cause the class to be initialized before the property is retrieved. Initialization consists of calling two static methods: __Init and __New.</p>
<p><code>static __Init</code> is defined automatically for every class, and always begins with a reference to the base class if one was specified, to ensure it is initialized. <a href="#Custom_Classes_staticvar">Static/class variables</a> and <a href="#Custom_Classes_class">nested classes</a> are initialized in the order that they were defined, except when a nested class is referenced during initialization of a previous variable or class.</p>
<p>If the class defines or inherits a <code>static __New</code> method, it is called immediately after __Init. It is important to note that __New may be called once for the class in which it is defined <em>and</em> once for each subclass which does not define its own (or which calls <code>super.__New()</code>). This can be used to perform common initialization tasks for each subclass, or modify subclasses in some way before they are used.</p>
<p>If <code>static __New</code> is not intended to act on derived classes, that can be avoided by checking the value of <code>this</code>. In some cases it may be sufficient for the method to delete itself, such as with <code>this.DeleteProp('__New')</code>; however, the first execution of __New might be for a subclass if one is nested in the base class or referenced during initialization of a static/class variable.</p>
<p>A class definition also has the effect of referencing the class. In other words, when execution reaches a class definition during <a href="Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>, __Init and __New are called automatically, unless the class was already referenced by the script. However, if execution is prevented from reaching the class definition, such as by <code>return</code> or an infinite loop, the class is initialized only if it is referenced.</p>
<p>Once automatic initialization begins, it will not occur again for the same class. This is generally not a problem unless multiple classes refer to each other. For example, consider the two classes below. When <code>A</code> is initialized first, evaluating <code>B.SharedArray</code> (A1) causes <code>B</code> to be initialized before retrieving and returning the value, but <code>A.SharedValue</code> (A3) is undefined and does not cause initialization of <code>A</code> because it is already in progress. In other words, if <code>A</code> is accessed or initialized first, the order is A1 to A3; otherwise it is B1 to B4:</p>
<pre>MsgBox A.SharedArray.Length
MsgBox B.SharedValue

class A {
    static SharedArray := B.SharedArray   <em>; A1          ; B3</em>
    static SharedValue := 42                            <em>; B4</em>
}

class B {
    static SharedArray := StrSplit("XYZ") <em>; A2          ; B1</em>
    static SharedValue := A.SharedValue   <em>; A3 (Error)  ; B2</em>
}</pre>

<h3 id="Meta_Functions">Meta-Functions</h3>
<pre class="Syntax">
class <i>ClassName</i> {
    __Get(Name, Params)
    __Set(Name, Params, Value)
    __Call(Name, Params)
}
</pre>
<dl>
  <dt>Name</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the property or method.</p></dd>
  <dt>Params</dt>
  <dd><p>An <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> of parameters. This includes only the parameters between <code>()</code> or <code>[]</code>, so may be empty. The meta-function is expected to handle cases such as <code>x.y[z]</code> where <code>x.y</code> is undefined.</p></dd>
  <dt>Value</dt>
  <dd><p>The value being assigned.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Meta-functions define what happens when an undefined property or method is invoked. For example, if <code>obj.unk</code> has not been assigned a value, it invokes the <i>__Get</i> meta-function. Similarly, <code>obj.unk := value</code> invokes <i>__Set</i> and <code>obj.unk()</code> invokes <i>__Call</i>.</p>
<p>Properties and methods can be defined in the object itself or any of its <a href="#delegation">base objects</a>. In general, for a meta-function to be called for every property, one must avoid defining any properties. Built-in properties such as <a href="lib/Object.htm#Base">Base</a> can be overridden with a <a href="#Custom_Classes_property">property definition</a> or <a href="lib/Object.htm#DefineProp">DefineProp</a>.</p>
<p>If a meta-function is defined, it must perform whatever default action is required. For example, the following might be expected:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Call</i>: Throw a <a href="lib/Error.htm#MethodError">MethodError</a>.</li>
  <li>If parameters were given, throw an exception (there's no object to forward the parameters to).</li>
  <li><i>Get</i>: Throw a <a href="lib/Error.htm#PropertyError">PropertyError</a>.</li>
  <li><i>Set</i>: Define a new property with the given value, such as by calling <a href="lib/Object.htm#DefineProp">DefineProp</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Any <a href="misc/Functor.htm">callable object</a> can be used as a meta-function by assigning it to the relevant property.</p>
<p>Meta-functions are not called in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>x[y]</code>: Using square brackets without a property name only invokes the <a href="#__Item">__Item</a> property.</li>
  <li><code>x()</code>: Calling the object itself only invokes the <code>Call</code> method. This includes internal calls made by built-in functions such as <a href="lib/SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a> and <a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a>.</li>
  <li>Internal calls to other meta-functions or double-underscore methods do not trigger <code>__Call</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Dynamic_Properties">Dynamic Properties</h4>
<p><a href="#Custom_Classes_property">Property syntax</a> and <a href="lib/Object.htm#DefineProp">DefineProp</a> can be used to define properties which compute a value each time they are evaluated, but each property must be defined in advance. By contrast, <em>__Get</em> and <em>__Set</em> can be used to implement properties which are known only at the moment they are invoked.</p>
<p>For example, a "proxy" object could be created which sends requests for properties over the network (or through some other channel). A remote server would send back a response containing the value of the property, and the proxy would return the value to its caller. Even if the name of each property was known in advance, it would not be logical to define each property individually in the proxy class since every property does the same thing (send a network request). Meta-functions receive the property name as a parameter, so are a good solution to this problem.</p>

<h2 id="primitive">Primitive Values</h2>
<p>Primitive values, such as strings and numbers, cannot have their own properties and methods. However, primitive values support the same kind of <a href="#delegation">delegation</a> as objects. That is, any property or method call on a primitive value is delegated to a predefined prototype object, which is also accessible via the <a href="lib/Class.htm#Prototype">Prototype</a> property of the corresponding class. The following classes relate to primitive values:</p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.5">
  <li>Primitive (extends <a href="lib/Any.htm">Any</a>) <ul style="padding-left: 1.7em">
    <li>Number <ul style="padding-left: 1.7em">
      <li>Float</li>
      <li>Integer</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>String</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Although checking the <a href="lib/Type.htm">Type</a> string is generally faster, the type of a value can be tested by checking whether it has a given base. For example, <code>n.HasBase(Number.Prototype)</code> or <code>n is Number</code> is true if <em>n</em> is a pure Integer or Float, but not if <em>n</em> is a numeric string, since String does not derive from Number. By contrast, <code>IsNumber(n)</code> is true if <em>n</em> is a number or a numeric string.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Any.htm#GetBase">ObjGetBase</a> and the <a href="lib/Any.htm#Base">Base</a> property return one of the predefined prototype objects when appropriate.</p>
<p>Note that <code>x is Any</code> would ordinarily be true for any value within AutoHotkey's type hierarchy, but false for COM objects.</p>

<h3 id="primitive-extension">Adding Properties and Methods</h3>
<p>Properties and methods can be added for all values of a given type by modifying that type's prototype object. However, since a primitive value is not an Object and cannot have its own properties or methods, the primitive prototype objects do not derive from <code>Object.Prototype</code>. In other words, methods such as <a href="lib/Object.htm#DefineProp">DefineProp</a> and <a href="lib/Object.htm#HasOwnProp">HasOwnProp</a> are not accessible by default. They can be called indirectly. For example:</p>
<pre>
DefProp := {}.DefineProp
DefProp( "".base, "Length", { get: StrLen } )
MsgBox A_AhkPath.length " == " StrLen(A_AhkPath)
</pre>
<p>Although primitive values can inherit value properties from their prototype, an exception is thrown if the script attempts to set a value property on a primitive value. For example:</p>
<pre>"".base.test := 1  <em>; Don't try this at home.</em>
MsgBox "".test  <em>; 1</em>
"".test := 2  <em>; Error: Property is read-only.</em></pre>
<p>Although __Set and property setters can be used, they are not useful since primitive values should be considered immutable.</p>

<h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2>
<span id="Refs"></span><h3 id="Reference_Counting">Reference-Counting</h3>
<p>AutoHotkey uses a basic reference-counting mechanism to automatically free the resources used by an object when it is no longer referenced by the script.  Script authors should not invoke this mechanism explicitly, except when dealing directly with unmanaged <a href="#ObjPtr">pointers to objects</a>.</p>
<p>Temporary references returned by functions, methods or operators within an expression are released after evaluation of that expression has completed or been aborted. In the following example, the new <a href="#GMem">GMem</a> object is freed only after MsgBox has returned:</p>
<pre>MsgBox <a href="lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>("GlobalSize", "ptr", GMem(0, 20).ptr, "ptr")  <em>; 20</em></pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> In this example, <code>.ptr</code> could have been omitted since the <a href="lib/DllCall.htm#ptr">Ptr</a> arg type permits objects with a <code>Ptr</code> property. However, the pattern shown above will work even with other property names.</p>
<p>To run code when the last reference to an object is being released, implement the <a href="#Custom_NewDelete">__Delete</a> meta-function.</p>
<p><b>Known Limitations:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Circular references must be broken before an object can be freed. For details and an example, see <a href="#Circular_References">Freeing Objects</a>.</li>
  <li>Although references in static and global variables are released automatically when the program exits, references in non-static local variables or on the expression evaluation stack are not.  These references are only released if the function or expression is allowed to complete normally.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although memory used by the object is reclaimed by the operating system when the program exits, <a href="#Custom_NewDelete">__Delete</a> will not be called unless all references to the object are freed.  This can be important if it frees other resources which are not automatically reclaimed by the operating system, such as temporary files.</p>

<h3 id="ObjPtr">Pointers to Objects</h3>
<p>In some rare cases it may be necessary to pass an object to external code via DllCall or store it in a binary data structure for later retrieval. An object's address can be retrieved via <code>address := ObjPtr(myObject)</code>; however, this effectively makes two references to the object, but the program only knows about the one in <em>myObject</em>. If the last <em>known</em> reference to the object was released, the object would be deleted. Therefore, the script must inform the object that it has gained a reference. This can be done as follows (the two lines below are equivalent):</p>
<pre>
ObjAddRef(address := ObjPtr(myObject))
address := ObjPtrAddRef(myObject)
</pre>
<p>The script must also inform the object when it is finished with that reference:</p>
<pre>ObjRelease(address)</pre>
<p>Generally each new copy of an object's address should be treated as another reference to the object, so the script should call <a href="lib/ObjAddRef.htm">ObjAddRef</a> when it gains a copy and <a href="lib/ObjAddRef.htm">ObjRelease</a> immediately before losing one. For example, whenever an address is copied via something like <code>x := address</code>, <a href="lib/ObjAddRef.htm">ObjAddRef</a> should be called. Similarly, when the script is finished with <em>x</em> (or is about to overwrite <em>x</em>'s value), it should call <a href="lib/ObjAddRef.htm">ObjRelease</a>.</p>
<p id="ObjFromPtr">To convert an address to a proper reference, use the ObjFromPtr function:</p>
<pre>myObject := ObjFromPtr(address)</pre>
<p>ObjFromPtr assumes that <em>address</em> is a counted reference, and claims ownership of it. In other words, <code>myObject := ""</code> would cause the reference originally represented by <em>address</em> to be released. After that, <em>address</em> must be considered invalid. To instead make a new reference, use one of the following:</p>
<pre>
ObjAddRef(address), myObject := ObjFromPtr(address)
myObject := ObjFromPtrAddRef(address)
</pre>

<h1>Using the Program</h1>
<p>AutoHotkey doesn't do anything on its own; it needs a script to tell it what to do. A script is simply a plain text file with the <code>.ahk</code> filename extension containing instructions for the program, like a configuration file, but much more powerful. A script can do as little as performing a single action and then exiting, but most scripts define a number of <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a>, with each hotkey followed by one or more actions to take when the hotkey is pressed.</p>
<pre>#z::Run "https://www.autohotkey.com"  <em>; Win+Z</em>

^!n::  <em>; Ctrl+Alt+N</em>
{
    if WinExist("Untitled - Notepad")
        WinActivate
    else
        Run "Notepad"
}</pre>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If your browser supports it, you can download any code block (such as the one above) as a script file by clicking the button which appears in the top-right of the code block when you hover your mouse over it.</p>

<h2 id="create">Create a Script</h2>
<p>There are a few common ways to create a script file:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Notepad (or a <a href="misc/Editors.htm">text editor</a> of your choice), save a file with the <code>.ahk</code> filename extension. On some systems you may need to enclose the name in quotes to ensure the editor does not add another extension (such as .txt).
  <p class="note">Be sure to save the file as UTF-8 with BOM if it will contain non-ASCII characters. For details, see the <a href="FAQ.htm#nonascii">FAQ</a>.</p></li>
  <li>In Explorer, right-click in empty space in the folder where you want to save the script, then select <strong>New</strong> and <strong>AutoHotkey Script</strong>. You can then type a name for the script (taking care not to erase the <code>.ahk</code> extension if it is visible).</li>
  <li>In the <a href="#dash">Dash</a>, select <a href="#newscript">New script</a>, type a name for the script (excluding the <code>.ahk</code> extension) and click <em>Create</em> or <em>Edit</em>. The template used to create the script and the location it will be saved can be configured within this window, and set as default if desired.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">See <a href="Language.htm">Scripting Language</a> for details about how to write a script.</p>

<h2 id="edit">Edit a Script</h2>
<p>To open a script for editing, right-click on the script file and select <strong>Edit Script</strong>. If the script is already running, you can use the <a href="lib/Edit.htm">Edit</a> function or right-click the script's <a href="#tray-icon">tray icon</a> and select <strong>Edit Script</strong>. If you haven't selected a default editor yet, you should be prompted to select one. Otherwise, you can change your default editor via <em>Editor settings</em> in the <a href="#dash">Dash</a>. Of course, you can always open a text editor first and then open the script as you would any other text file.</p>
<p>After editing a script, you must run or <a href="lib/Reload.htm">reload</a> the script for the changes to take effect. A running script can usually be reloaded via its <a href="#tray-icon">tray menu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="run">Run a Script</h2>
<p>With AutoHotkey installed, there are several ways to run a script:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click a script file (or shortcut to a script file) in Explorer.</li>
<li>Call AutoHotkey.exe on the command line and pass the script's filename as a <a href="Scripts.htm#cmd">command-line parameter</a>.</li>
<li>After creating <a href="Scripts.htm#defaultfile">the default script</a>, launch AutoHotkey via the shortcut in the Start menu to run it.</li>
<li>If AutoHotkey is pinned to the taskbar or Start menu on Windows 7 or later, recent or pinned scripts can be launched via the program's Jump List.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most scripts have an effect only while they are running. Use the <a href="#tray-icon">tray menu</a> or the <a href="lib/ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> function to exit a script. Scripts are also forced to exit when Windows shuts down. To configure a script to start automatically after the user logs in, the easiest way is to place a shortcut to the script file in the <a href="Variables.htm#Startup">Startup</a> folder.</p>
<p>Scripts can also be <a href="Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">compiled</a>; that is, combined together with an AutoHotkey binary file to form a self-contained executable (.exe) file.</p>

<h2 id="tray-icon">Tray Icon</h2>
<p>By default, each script adds its own icon to the taskbar notification area (commonly known as the tray).</p>
<p>The tray icon usually looks like this (but the color or letter changes when the script is <a href="lib/Pause.htm">paused</a> or <a href="lib/Suspend.htm">suspended</a>): <img src="static/ahk16.png" alt="H"></p>
<p>Right-click the tray icon to show the tray menu, which has the following options by default:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open - Open the script's <a href="#main-window">main window</a>.</li>
<li>Help - Open the AutoHotkey offline help file.</li>
<li>Window Spy - Displays various information about a window.</li>

</ul>
<p>By default, double-clicking the tray icon shows the script's <a href="#main-window">main window</a>.</p>
<p>The behavior and appearance of the tray icon and menu can be customized:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Variables.htm#TrayMenu">A_TrayMenu</a> returns a <a href="lib/Menu.htm">Menu object</a> which can be used to customise the tray menu.</li>
  <li><a href="Variables.htm#IconHidden">A_IconHidden</a> or the <a href="lib/_NoTrayIcon.htm">#NoTrayIcon</a> directive can be used to hide (or show) the tray icon.</li>
  <li><a href="Variables.htm#IconTip">A_IconTip</a> can be assigned new tooltip text for the tray icon.</li>
  <li><a href="lib/TraySetIcon.htm">TraySetIcon</a> can be used to change the icon.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="main-window">Main Window</h2>
<p>The script's main window is usually hidden, but can be shown via the <a href="#tray-icon">tray icon</a> or one of the functions listed below to gain access to information useful for debugging the script. Items under the <strong>View</strong> menu control what the main window displays:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lines most recently executed - See <a href="lib/ListLines.htm">ListLines</a>.</li>
<li>Variables and their contents - See <a href="lib/ListVars.htm">ListVars</a>.</li>
<li>Hotkeys and their methods - See <a href="lib/ListHotkeys.htm">ListHotkeys</a>.</li>
<li>Key history and script info - See <a href="lib/KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known issue:</strong> Keyboard shortcuts for menu items do not work while the script is displaying a <a href="lib/MsgBox.htm">message box</a> or other dialog.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <a href="Variables.htm#ScriptHwnd">A_ScriptHwnd</a> contains the unique ID (HWND) of the script's main window.</p>
<p>Closing this window with <a href="lib/WinClose.htm">WinClose</a> (even from another script) causes the script to exit, but most other methods just hide the window and leave the script running.</p>
<p>Minimizing the main window causes it to automatically be hidden. This is done to prevent any owned windows (such as GUI windows or certain dialog windows) from automatically being minimized, but also has the effect of hiding the main window's taskbar button. To instead allow the main window to be minimized normally, override the default handling with <a href="lib/OnMessage.htm">OnMessage</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>; This prevents the main window from hiding on minimize:
OnMessage 0x0112, PreventAutoMinimize <em>; WM_SYSCOMMAND = 0x0112</em>
OnMessage 0x0005, PreventAutoMinimize <em>; WM_SIZE = 0x0005
; This prevents owned GUI windows (but not dialogs) from automatically minimizing:</em>
OnMessage 0x0018, PreventAutoMinimize
Persistent

PreventAutoMinimize(wParam, lParam, uMsg, hwnd) {
    if (uMsg = 0x0112 &amp;&amp; wParam = 0xF020 &amp;&amp; hwnd = A_ScriptHwnd) { <em>; SC_MINIMIZE = 0xF020</em>
        WinMinimize
        return 0 <em>; Prevent main window from hiding.</em>
    }
    if (uMsg = 0x0005 &amp;&amp; wParam = 1 &amp;&amp; hwnd = A_ScriptHwnd) <em>; SIZE_MINIMIZED = 1</em>
        return 0 <em>; Prevent main window from hiding.</em>
    if (uMsg = 0x0018 &amp;&amp; lParam = 1) <em>; SW_PARENTCLOSING = 1</em>
        return 0 <em>; Prevent owned window from minimizing.</em>
}</pre>

<h3 id="title">Main Window Title</h3>
<p>The title of the script's main window is used by the <a href="lib/_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a> and <a href="lib/Reload.htm">Reload</a> mechanisms to identify other instances of the same script. <a href="lib/WinSetTitle.htm">Changing the title</a> prevents the script from being identified as such. The default title depends on how the script was loaded:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr><th>Loaded From</th><th>Title Expression</th><th>Example</th></tr>
  <tr><td>.ahk file</td><td><code>A_ScriptFullPath " - AutoHotkey v" A_AhkVersion</code></td><td>E:\My Script.ahk - AutoHotkey v1.1.33.09</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Main resource (compiled script)</td><td><code>A_ScriptFullPath</code></td><td>E:\My Script.exe</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Any other resource</td><td><code>A_ScriptFullPath " - " A_LineFile</code></td><td>E:\My AutoHotkey.exe - *BUILTIN-TOOL.AHK</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The following code illustrates how the default title could be determined by the script itself (but the actual title can be retrieved with <a href="lib/WinGetTitle.htm">WinGetTitle</a>):</p>
<pre>
title := A_ScriptFullPath
if !A_IsCompiled
    title .= " - AutoHotkey v" A_AhkVersion
<em>; For the correct result, this must be evaluated by the resource being executed,
; not an #include (unless the #include was merged into the script by Ahk2Exe):</em>
else if SubStr(A_LineFile, 1, 1) = "*" &amp;&amp; A_LineFile != "*#1"
    title .= " - " A_LineFile
</pre>

<h2 id="embedded-scripts">Embedded Scripts</h2>
<p>Scripts may be embedded into a standard AutoHotkey .exe file by adding them as Win32 (RCDATA) resources using the <a href="Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">Ahk2Exe compiler</a>. To add additional scripts, see the <a href="misc/Ahk2ExeDirectives.htm#AddResource">AddResource</a> compiler directive.</p>
<p>An embedded script can be specified on the command line or with <a href="lib/_Include.htm">#Include</a> by writing an asterisk (*) followed by the resource name. For an integer ID, the resource name must be a hash sign (#) followed by a decimal number.</p>
<p>The program may automatically load script code from the following resources, if present in the file:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr><th>ID</th><th>Spec</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>*#1</td>
    <td>This is the means by which a <a href="Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">compiled script</a> is created from an .exe file. This script is executed automatically and most command line switches are passed to the script instead of being interpreted by the program. External scripts and alternative embedded scripts can be executed by using the <a href="Scripts.htm#SlashScript">/script</a> switch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td><td>*#2</td>
    <td>If present, this script is automatically "included" before any script that the program loads, and before any file specified with <a href="Scripts.htm#SlashInclude">/include</a>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When the source of the main script is an embedded resource, the program acts in "compiled script" mode, with the exception that <a href="Variables.htm#AhkPath">A_AhkPath</a> always contains the path of the current executable file (the same as <a href="Variables.htm#ScriptFullPath">A_ScriptFullPath</a>). For resources other than *#1, the resource specifier is included in <a href="#title">the main window's title</a> to support <a href="lib/_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a> and <a href="lib/Reload.htm">Reload</a>.</p>
<p>When referenced from code that came from an embedded resource, <a href="Variables.htm#LineFile">A_LineFile</a> contains an asterisk (*) followed by the resource name.</p>

<h2 id="cmd">Command Line Usage</h2>
<p>See <a href="Scripts.htm#cmd">Passing Command Line Parameters to a Script</a> for command line usage, including a list of command line switches which affect the program's behavior.</p>

<h2 id="portability">Portability of AutoHotkey.exe</h2>
<p>The file AutoHotkey.exe is all that is needed to launch any .ahk script.</p>
<p>Renaming AutoHotkey.exe also changes which script it runs <a href="Scripts.htm#defaultfile">by default</a>, which can be an alternative to compiling a script for use on a computer without AutoHotkey installed. For instance, <i>MyScript</i>.exe automatically runs <i>MyScript</i>.ahk if a filename is not supplied, but is also capable of running other scripts.</p>

<h2 id="launcher">Launcher</h2>
<p>The launcher enables the use of v1 and v2 scripts on one system, with a single filename extension, without necessarily giving preference to one version or requiring different methods of launching scripts. It does this by checking the script for clues about which version it requires, and then locating an appropriate exe to run the script.</p>
<p>If the script contains the <a href="lib/_Requires.htm">#Requires</a> directive, the launcher looks for an exe that satisfies the requirement. Otherwise, the launcher optionally checks syntax. That is, it checks for patterns that are valid only in one of the two major versions. Some of the common patterns it may find include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>v1: <code>MsgBox, with comma</code>, <code>MsgBox % "no end percent"</code> and <code>Legacy = assignment</code>.</li>
  <li>v1: Multi-line hotkeys without braces or a function definition.</li>
  <li>Common directives such as #NoEnv and #If (v1) or <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> (v2).</li>
  <li>v2: Unambiguous use of <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation-expr">continuation by enclosure</a> or <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation-line">end-of-line continuation operators</a>.</li>
  <li>v2: Unambiguous use of <code>'single quotes'</code> or <a href="Variables.htm#fat-arrow">fat arrow <code>=&gt;</code></a> in an expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>Detection is conservative; if a case is ambiguous, it should generally be ignored.</p>
<p>In any case where detection fails, by default a menu is shown for the user to select a version. This default can be changed to instead launch either v1 or v2.</p>
<p><strong>Known limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Only the main file is checked.</li>
  <li>Since it is legal to include a line like <code>/****/</code> in v1, but <code>*/</code> at line-end only closes comments in v2, the presence of such a line may cause a large portion of the script to be ignored (by both the launcher and the v1 interpreter).</li>
  <li>Only syntax is checked, not semantics. For instance, <code>xyz,</code> is invalid in v2, so is assumed to be a valid v1 command. <code>xyz 1</code> could be a function statement in v2, but is assumed to also be a valid v1 command, and is therefore ignored.</li>
  <li>Since the patterns being detected are effectively syntax errors in one version, a script with actual syntax errors or incorrectly mixed syntax might be misidentified.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Declaring the required version with <a href="lib/_Requires.htm">#Requires</a> at the top of the main file eliminates any ambiguity.</p>

<h3 id="launcher-config">Launch Settings</h3>
<p>The launcher can be enabled, disabled or configured via the Launch Settings GUI, which can be accessed via the <a href="#dash">dash</a>.</p>
<p><em>Run all scripts with a specific interpreter</em> disables the launcher and allows the user to select which exe to use to run all scripts, the traditional way. Be aware that selecting a v1 exe will make it difficult to run any of the support scripts, except via the "AutoHotkey" shortcut in the Start menu.</p>
<p><em>Auto-detect version when launching script</em> enables the launcher. Additional settings control how the launcher selects which interpreter to use.</p>

<h3 id="launcher-criteria">Criteria</h3>
<p>When multiple interpreters with the same version number are found, the launcher can rank them according to a predetermined or user-defined set of criteria. The criteria can be expressed as a comma-delimited list of substrings, where each substring may be prefixed with "!" to negate a match. A score is calculated based on which substrings matched, with the left-most substring having highest priority.</p>
<p>Substrings are matched in the file's description, with the exception of "UIA", which matches if the filename contains "_UIA".</p>
<p>For example, <code>_H, 64, !ANSI</code> would prefer AutoHotkey_H if available, 64-bit if compatible with the system, and finally Unicode over ANSI.</p>
<p>Although the Launcher Settings GUI presents drop-down lists with options such as "Unicode 32-bit", a list of substrings can be manually entered.</p>
<p>Additional (higher-priority) criteria can be specified on the command line with the <a href="#SlashRunWith">/RunWith</a> launcher switch.</p>
<p>Criteria can be specified within the script by using the <a href="lib/_Requires.htm">#Requires</a> directive, either as a requirement (if supported by the target AutoHotkey version), or appended to the directive as a comment beginning with "prefer" and ending with a full stop or line ending. For example:</p>
<pre>#Requires AutoHotkey v1.1.35 <em>; prefer 64-bit, Unicode.  More comments.</em></pre>

<h3 id="launcher-run">Run *Launch</h3>
<p>The installer registers a hidden shell verb named "launch", which executes the launcher with the <a href="#SlashLaunch">/Launch</a> switch. It can be utilized by following this example:</p>
<pre>pid := RunWait('*Launch "' PathOfScript '"')</pre>
<p>By contrast with the default action for .ahk files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>/Launch causes the process ID (PID) of the newly launched script to be returned as the launcher's exit code, whereas it would normally return the launched script's exit code. Run's <em>OutputVarPID</em> parameter returns the PID of the launcher.</li>
  <li>/Launch causes the launcher to exit immediately after launching the script. If /Launch is not used, the launcher generally has to assume that its parent process might be doing something like <code>RunWait(PathOfScript)</code>, which wouldn't work as expected if the launcher exited before the launched script.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="launcher-cmd">Command-line Usage</h3>
<p>The launcher can be explicitly executed at the command line for cases where .ahk files are not set to use the launcher by default, or for finer control over its behaviour. If the launcher is compiled, its usage is essentially the same as AutoHotkey.exe except for the additional launcher switches. Otherwise, the format for command line use is as follows:</p>
<pre>AutoHotkeyUX.exe launcher.ahk [<i>Switches</i>] [<i>Script Filename</i>] [<i>Script Parameters</i>]</pre>
<p>Typically full paths and quote marks would be used for the path to AutoHotkeyUX.exe and launcher.ahk, which can be found in the UX subdirectory of the AutoHotkey installation. An appropriate version of AutoHotkey32.exe or AutoHotkey64.exe can be used instead of AutoHotkeyUX.exe (which is just a copy).</p>
<p><em>Switches</em> can be a mixture of any of the <a href="Scripts.htm#cmd">standard switches</a> and the following launcher-only switches:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr><th>Switch</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
  <tr id="SlashLaunch">
    <td>/Launch</td>
    <td>Causes the launcher to exit immediately after launching the script, instead of waiting in the background for it to terminate. The launcher's exit code is the process ID (PID) of the new script process.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="SlashRunWith">
    <td>/RunWith <em>criteria</em></td>
    <td>Specifies additional <a href="#launcher-criteria">criteria</a> for determining which executable to use to launch the script. For example, <code>/RunWith UIA</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="SlashWhich">
    <td>/Which</td>
    <td>
      <p>Causes the launcher to identify which interpreter it would use and return it instead of running the script.</p>
      <p>The launcher's exit code is the major version number (1 or 2) if identified by #Requires or syntax (if syntax detection is enabled), otherwise 0.</p>
      <p>Stdout receives the following UTF-8 strings, each terminated with <code>`n</code>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The version number. If #Requires was detected, this is whatever number it specified, excluding "v". Otherwise, it is an integer the same as the exit code, unless the version wasn't detected, in which case this is 0 to indicate that the user would have been prompted, or 1 or 2 to indicate the user's preferred version as configured in the Launch Settings.</li>
        <li>The path of the interpreter EXE that would be used, if one was found. This is blank if the user would have been prompted or no compatible interpreters were found.</li>
        <li>Any additional command-line switches that the launcher would insert, such as <code>/CP65001</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additional lines may be returned in future.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="dash">Dash</h2>
<p>The dash provides access to support scripts and documentation. It can be opened via the "AutoHotkey" shortcut in the Start menu after installation, or by directly running UX\ui-dash.ahk from the installation directory. Currently it is little more than a menu containing the following items, but it might be expanded to provide controls for active scripts, or other convenient functions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>New script: Create a new script from a template.</li>
  <li>Compile: Opens Ahk2Exe, or offers to automatically download and install it.</li>
  <li>Help files (F1): Shows a menu containing help files and online documentation for v1 and v2, and any other CHM files found in the installation directory.</li>
  <li>Window spy</li>
  <li>Launch settings: Configure the launcher.</li>
  <li>Editor settings: Set the default editor for .ahk files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that although the Start menu shortcut launches the dash, if it is pinned to the taskbar (or to the Start menu in Windows 7 or 10), the jump list will include any recent scripts launched with the <em>open</em>, <em>runas</em> or <em>UIAccess</em> shell verbs (which are normally accessed via the Explorer context menu or by double-clicking a file). Scripts can be pinned for easy access.</p>

<h2 id="newscript">New Script</h2>
<p>The New Script GUI can be accessed via the dash or by right-clicking within a folder in Explorer and selecting New &rarr; AutoHotkey Script. It can be used to create a new script file from a preinstalled or user-defined template, and optionally open it for editing.</p>
<p>Right-clicking on a template in the list gives the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Edit template: Open the template in the default editor. If it is a preinstalled template, an editable copy is created instead of opening the original.</li>
  <li>Hide template: Adds the template name to a list of templates that will not be shown in the GUI. To unhide a template, delete the corresponding registry value from <code>HKCU\Software\AutoHotkey\New\HideTemplate</code>.</li>
  <li>Set as default: Sets the template to be selected by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the GUI closes after creating a file unless the Ctrl key is held down.</p>
<p>Additional settings can be accessed via the settings button at the bottom-left of the GUI:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Default to Create: Pressing Enter will activate the Create button, which creates the script and selects it in Explorer.</li>
  <li>Default to Edit: Pressing Enter will activate the Edit button, which creates the script and opens it in the default script editor.</li>
  <li>Stay open: If enabled, the window will not close automatically after creating a script.</li>
  <li>Set folder as default: Sets the current folder as the default location to save scripts. The default location is used if the New Script window is opened directly or via the Dash; it is not used when New Script is invoked via the Explorer context menu.</li>
  <li>Open templates folder: Opens the folder where user-defined <a href="#templates">templates</a> can be stored.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>
<p>Template files are drawn from UX\Templates (preinstalled) and <em>%A_MyDocuments%</em>\AutoHotkey\Templates (user), with a user-defined template overriding any preinstalled template which has the same name. If a file exists at <em>%A_WinDir%</em>\ShellNew\Template.ahk, it is shown as "Legacy" and can be overridden by a user-defined template of that name.</p>
<p>Each template may contain an INI section as follows:</p>
<pre>/*
[NewScriptTemplate]
Description = Descriptive text
Execute = true|false|1|0
*/</pre>
<p>If the INI section starts with <code>/*</code> and ends with <code>*/</code> as shown above, it is not included in the created file.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> is optional. It is shown in the GUI, in addition to the file's name.</p>
<p><strong>Execute</strong> is optional. If set to true, the template script is executed with <code>A_Args[1]</code> containing the path of the file to be created and <code>A_Args[2]</code> containing either "Create" or "Edit", depending on which button the user clicked. The template script is expected to create the file and open it for editing if applicable. If the template script needs to <code>#include</code> other files, they can be placed in a subdirectory to avoid having them shown in the template list.</p>

<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>
<p>This installer and related scripts are designed to permit multiple versions of AutoHotkey to coexist. The installer provides very few options, as most things can be configured after installation. Only the following choices must be made during installation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where to install.</li>
  <li>Whether to install for all users or the current user.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default the installer will install to "%A_ProgramFiles%\AutoHotkey" for all users. This is recommended, as the UI Access option requires the program to be installed under Program Files. If the installer is not already running as admin, it will attempt to elevate when the Install button is clicked, as indicated by the shield icon on the button.</p>
<p>Current user installation does not require admin rights, as long as the user has write access to the chosen directory. The default directory for a current user installation is "%LocalAppData%\Programs\AutoHotkey".</p>

<h3 id="install_v1">Installing with v1</h3>
<p>There are two methods of installing v1 and v2 together:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install v1 first, and then v2. In that case, the v1 files are left in the root of the installation directory, to avoid breaking any external tools or shortcuts that rely on their current path.</li>
  <li>Install v1 as an additional version. Running a v1.1.34.03 or later installer gives this option. Alternatively, use the <code>/install</code> switch described below. Each version installs into its own subdirectory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Running a v1.1.34.02 or older installer (or a custom install with v1.1.34.03 or newer) will overwrite some of the values set in the registry by the v2 installer, such as the version number, uninstaller entry and parts of the file type registration. It will also register the v1 uninstaller, which is not capable of correctly uninstalling both versions. To re-register v2, re-run any v2 installer or run UX\install.ahk using AutoHotkey32.exe or AutoHotkey64.exe.</p>

<h3 id="installdef">Default Version</h3>
<p>Unlike a v1 installation, a default version is not selected during installation. Defaults are instead handled more dynamically by the launcher, and can be configured per-user.</p>

<h3 id="installcmd">Command Line Usage</h3>
<p>To directly install to the <em>DESTINATION</em> directory, use <code>/installto</code> or <code>/to</code> (the two switches are interchangeable) as shown below, from within the source directory. Use either a downloaded setup.exe or files extracted from a downloaded zip or other source.</p>
<pre>AutoHotkey_setup.exe /installto "%DESTINATION%"</pre>
<pre>AutoHotkey32.exe UX\install.ahk /to "%DESTINATION%"</pre>
<p>To install an additional version from <em>SOURCE</em> (which should be a directory containing AutoHotkey*.exe files), execute the following from within the current installation directory (adjusting the path of AutoHotkey32.exe as needed):</p>
<pre>AutoHotkey32.exe UX\install.ahk /install "%SOURCE%"</pre>
<p>The full command string for the above is registered as <em>InstallCommand</em> under <code>HKLM\Software\AutoHotkey</code> or <code>HKCU\Software\AutoHotkey</code>, with <code class="no-highlight">%1</code> as the substitute for the source directory. Using this registry value may be more future-proof.</p>
<p>To re-register the current installation:</p>
<pre>AutoHotkey32.exe UX\install.ahk</pre>
<p>To uninstall:</p>
<pre>AutoHotkey32.exe UX\install.ahk /uninstall</pre>
<p>Alternatively, read the <em>QuietUninstallString</em> value from one of the following registry keys, and execute it:</p>
<pre>HKLM\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\AutoHotkey
HKCU\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\AutoHotkey</pre>
<p>Use the <code>/silent</code> switch to suppress warning or confirmation dialogs and prevent the <a href="#dash">Dash</a> from being shown when installation is complete. The following actions may be taken automatically, without warning:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Terminate scripts to allow AutoHotkey*.exe to be overwritten.</li>
  <li>Overwrite files that were not previously registered by the installer, or that were modified since registration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Installer_IsHostApp">Taskbar Buttons</h3>
<p>The v2 installer does not provide an option to separate taskbar buttons. This was previously achieved by registering each AutoHotkey executable as a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/shell/app-registration">host app (IsHostApp)</a>, but this approach has limitations, and becomes less manageable when multiple versions can be installed. Instead, each script should set the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/shell/appids">AppUserModelID</a> of its process or windows to control grouping.</p>

<h3 id="Installer_uiAccess">Run with UI Access</h3>
<p>When installing under Program Files, the installer creates an additional set of AutoHotkey exe files that can be used to work around some <a href="FAQ.htm#uac">common UAC-related issues</a>. These files are given the "_UIA.exe" suffix. When one of these UIA.exe files is used by an administrator to run a script, the script is able to interact with windows of programs that run as admin, without the script itself running as admin.</p>
<p>The installer does the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copies each AutoHotkey*.exe to AutoHotkey*_UIA.exe.</li>
  <li>Sets the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winauto/uiauto-securityoverview">uiAccess attribute</a> in each UIA.exe file's embedded manifest.</li>
  <li>Creates a self-signed digital certificate named "AutoHotkey" and signs each UIA.exe file.</li>
  <li>Registers the <em>UIAccess</em> shell verb, which appears in Explorer's context menu as "Run with UI access". By default this executes the <a href="#launcher">launcher</a>, which tries to select an appropriate UIA.exe file to run the script.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="#launcher">launcher</a> can also be configured to run v1 scripts, v2 scripts or both with UI Access by default, but this option has no effect if a UIA.exe file does not exist for the selected version and build.</p>
<p>Scripts which need to run other scripts with UI access can simply <a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> the appropriate UIA.exe file with the normal <a href="#cmd">command line parameters</a>. Alternatively, if the <em>UIAccess</em> shell verb is registered, it can be used via Run. For example: <code>Run '*UIAccess "Script.ahk"'</code></p>
<p><strong>Known limitations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UIA is only effective if the file is in a trusted location; i.e. a Program Files sub-directory.</li>
  <li>UIA.exe files created on one computer cannot run on other computers without first installing the digital certificate which was used to sign them.</li>
  <li>UIA.exe files cannot be started via CreateProcess due to security restrictions. ShellExecute can be used instead. <a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> tries both.</li>
  <li>UIA.exe files cannot be modified, as it would invalidate the file's digital signature.</li>
  <li>Because UIA programs run at a different "integrity level" than other programs, they can only access objects registered by other UIA programs. For example, <code><a href="lib/ComObjActive.htm">ComObjActive</a>("Word.Application")</code> will fail because Word is not marked for UI Access.</li>
  <li>The script's own windows can't be automated by non-UIA programs/scripts for security reasons.</li>
  <li>Running a non-UIA script which uses a mouse hook (even as simple as <code>InstallMouseHook</code>) may prevent all mouse hotkeys from working when the mouse is pointing at a window owned by a UIA script, even hotkeys implemented by the UIA script itself. A workaround is to ensure UIA scripts are loaded last.</li>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Each script is a plain text file containing lines to be executed by the program (AutoHotkey.exe). A script may also contain <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> and <a href="Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a>, or even consist entirely of them. However, in the absence of hotkeys and hotstrings, a script will perform its functions sequentially from top to bottom the moment it is launched.</p>
<p>The program loads the script into memory line by line. During loading, the script is <a href="misc/Performance.htm">optimized</a> and validated. Any syntax errors will be displayed, and they must be corrected before the script can run.</p>

<h2 id="auto">Script Startup (the Auto-execute Thread)</h2>
<p>After the script has been loaded, the <em>auto-execute thread</em> begins executing at the script's top line, and continues until instructed to stop, such as by <a href="lib/Return.htm">Return</a>, <a href="lib/ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> or <a href="lib/Exit.htm">Exit</a>. The physical end of the script also acts as <a href="lib/Exit.htm">Exit</a>.</p>
<p id="persistent">The script will terminate after completing startup if it lacks <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a>, <a href="Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a>, visible <a href="lib/Gui.htm">GUIs</a>, active <a href="lib/SetTimer.htm">timers</a>, <a href="lib/OnClipboardChange.htm">clipboard monitors</a> and <a href="lib/InputHook.htm">InputHooks</a>, and has not called the <a href="lib/Persistent.htm">Persistent</a> function. Otherwise, it will stay running in an idle state, responding to events such as hotkeys, hotstrings, <a href="lib/GuiOnEvent.htm">GUI events</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm">custom menu items</a>, and <a href="lib/SetTimer.htm">timers</a>. If these conditions change after startup completes (for example, the last timer is disabled), the script may exit when the last running thread completes or the last GUI closes.</p>
<p>Whenever any new <a href="misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> is launched (whether by a <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Hotstrings.htm">hotstring</a>, <a href="lib/SetTimer.htm">timer</a>, or some other event), the following settings are copied from the auto-execute thread. If not set by the auto-execute thread, the standard defaults will apply (as documented on each of the following pages): <a href="lib/CoordMode.htm">CoordMode</a>, <a href="lib/Critical.htm">Critical</a>, <a href="lib/DetectHiddenText.htm">DetectHiddenText</a>, <a href="lib/DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a>, <a href="lib/FileEncoding.htm">FileEncoding</a>, <a href="lib/ListLines.htm">ListLines</a>, <a href="lib/SendLevel.htm">SendLevel</a>, <a href="lib/SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>, <a href="lib/SetControlDelay.htm">SetControlDelay</a>, <a href="lib/SetDefaultMouseSpeed.htm">SetDefaultMouseSpeed</a>, <a href="lib/SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a>, <a href="lib/SetMouseDelay.htm">SetMouseDelay</a>, <a href="lib/SetRegView.htm">SetRegView</a>, <a href="lib/SetStoreCapsLockMode.htm">SetStoreCapsLockMode</a>, <a href="lib/SetTitleMatchMode.htm">SetTitleMatchMode</a>, <a href="lib/SetWinDelay.htm">SetWinDelay</a>, and <a href="lib/Thread.htm">Thread</a>.</p>
<p>Each <a href="misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> retains its own collection of the above settings, so changes made to those settings will not affect other threads.</p>
<p>The "default setting" for one of the above functions usually refers to the current setting of the auto-execute thread, which starts out the same as the program-defined default setting.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the top of the script has been referred to as the <em>auto-execute section</em>. However, the auto-execute thread is not limited to just the top of the script. Any functions which are called on the auto-execute thread may also affect the default settings. As directives and function, hotkey, hotstring and class definitions are skipped when encountered during execution, it is possible for startup code to be placed throughout each file. For example, a global variable used by a group of hotkeys may be initialized above (or even below) those hotkeys rather than at the top of the script.</p>

<h2 id="continuation">Splitting a Long Line into a Series of Shorter Ones</h2>
<p>Long lines can be divided up into a collection of smaller ones to improve readability and maintainability. This does not reduce the script's execution speed because such lines are merged in memory the moment the script launches.</p>
<p>There are three methods, and they can generally be used in combination:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#continuation-line">Continuation operator</a>: Start or end a line with an expression operator to join it to the previous or next line.</li>
  <li><a href="#continuation-expr">Continuation by enclosure</a>: A sub-expression enclosed in (), [] or {} can automatically span multiple lines in most cases.</li>
  <li><a href="#continuation-section">Continuation section</a>: Mark a group of lines to be merged together, with additional options such as what text (or code) to insert between lines.</li>
</ul>
<p id="continuation-line"><strong>Continuation operator</strong>: A line that starts with a comma or any other <a href="Variables.htm#Operators">expression operator</a> (except ++ and --) is automatically merged with the line directly above it. Similarly, a line that ends with an expression operator is automatically merged with the line below it. In the following example, the second line is appended to the first because it begins with a comma:</p>
<pre>FileAppend "This is the text to append.`n"   <em>; A comment is allowed here.</em>
    <strong>,</strong> A_ProgramFiles "\SomeApplication\LogFile.txt"  <em>; Comment.</em></pre>
<p>Similarly, the following lines would get merged into a single line because the last two start with "and" or "or":</p>
<pre>if Color = "Red" or Color = "Green"  or Color = "Blue"   <em>; Comment.</em>
    <strong>or</strong> Color = "Black" or Color = "Gray" or Color = "White"   <em>; Comment.</em>
    <strong>and</strong> ProductIsAvailableInColor(Product, Color)   <em>; Comment.</em></pre>
<p>The <a href="Variables.htm#ternary">ternary operator</a> is also a good candidate:</p>
<pre>ProductIsAvailable := (Color = "Red")
    <strong>?</strong> false  <em>; We don't have any red products, so don't bother calling the function.</em>
    <strong>:</strong> ProductIsAvailableInColor(Product, Color)</pre>
<p>The following examples are equivalent to those above:</p>
<pre>FileAppend "This is the text to append.`n"<strong>,</strong>   <em>; A comment is allowed here.</em>
    A_ProgramFiles "\SomeApplication\LogFile.txt"  <em>; Comment.</em>

if Color = "Red" or Color = "Green"  or Color = "Blue" <strong>or</strong>   <em>; Comment.</em>
    Color = "Black" or Color = "Gray" or Color = "White" <strong>and</strong>   <em>; Comment.</em>
    ProductIsAvailableInColor(Product, Color)   <em>; Comment.</em>

ProductIsAvailable := (Color = "Red") <strong>?</strong>
    false <strong>:</strong> <em>; We don't have any red products, so don't bother calling the function.</em>
    ProductIsAvailableInColor(Product, Color)</pre>
<p>Although the indentation used in the examples above is optional, it might improve clarity by indicating which lines belong to ones above them. Also, blank lines or <a href="Language.htm#comments">comments</a> may be added between or at the end of any of the lines in the above examples.</p>
<p>A continuation operator cannot be used with an auto-replace hotstring or directive other than <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a>.</p>
<p id="continuation-expr"><strong>Continuation by enclosure</strong>: If a line contains an expression or function/property definition with an unclosed <code>(</code>/<code>[</code>/<code>{</code>, it is joined with subsequent lines until the number of opening and closing symbols balances out. In other words, a sub-expression enclosed in parentheses, brackets or braces can automatically span multiple lines in most cases. For example:</p>
<pre>
myarray := [
  "item 1",
  "item 2",
]
MsgBox(
    "The value of item 2 is " myarray[2],
    "Title",
    "ok iconi"
    )
</pre>
<p>Continuation expressions may contain both types of <a href="Language.htm#comments">comments</a>.</p>
<p>Continuation expressions may contain normal <a href="#continuation-section">continuation sections</a>. Therefore, as with any line containing an expression, if a line begins with a non-escaped open parenthesis (<code>(</code>), it is considered to be the start of a continuation section unless there is a closing parenthesis (<code>)</code>) on the same line.</p>
<p>Quoted strings cannot span multiple lines using this method alone. However, see above.</p>
<p>Continuation by enclosure can be combined with a continuation operator. For example:</p>
<pre>myarray :=  <em>; The assignment operator causes continuation.</em>
[  <em>; Brackets enclose the following two lines.</em>
  "item 1",
  "item 2",
]</pre>
<p>Brace (<code>{</code>) at the end of a line does not cause continuation if the program determines that it should be interpreted as the beginning of a block (<a href="lib/Block.htm#otb">OTB style</a>) rather than the start of an <a href="Language.htm#object-literal">object literal</a>. Specifically (in descending order of precedence):</p>
<ul>
  <li>A brace is never interpreted as the beginning of a block if it is preceded by an unclosed <code>(</code>/<code>[</code>/<code>{</code>, since that would produce an invalid expression. For example, the brace in <code>If ({</code> is the start of an object literal.</li>
  <li>An object literal cannot legally follow <code>)</code> or <code>]</code>, so if the brace follows either of those symbols (excluding whitespace), it is interpreted as the beginning of a block (such as for a function or property definition).</li>
  <li>For <a href="Language.htm#control-flow">control flow statements</a> which require a body (and therefore support OTB), the brace can be the start of an object literal only if it is preceded by an operator, such as <code>:= {</code> or <code>for x <strong>in</strong> {</code>. In particular, the brace in <code>Loop {</code> is always block-begin, and <code>If {</code> and <code>While {</code> are always errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>A brace can be safely used for line continuation with any function call, expression or control flow statement which does not require a body. For example:</p>
<pre>myfn() {
    return {
        key: "value"
    }
}</pre>
<p id="continuation-section"><strong>Continuation section</strong>: This method should be used to merge a large number of lines or when the lines are not suitable for the other methods. Although this method is especially useful for <a href="Hotstrings.htm">auto-replace hotstrings</a>, it can also be used with any <a href="Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>. For example:</p>
<pre><em>; EXAMPLE #1:</em>
Var := "
(
A line of text.
By default, the hard carriage return (Enter) between the previous line and this one will be stored.
	This line is indented with a tab; by default, that tab will also be stored.
Additionally, "quote marks" are <a href="#continuation_quotes">automatically escaped</a> when appropriate.
)"

<em>; EXAMPLE #2:</em>
FileAppend "
(
Line 1 of the text.
Line 2 of the text. By default, a linefeed (`n) is present between lines.
)", A_Desktop "\My File.txt"</pre>
<p>In the examples above, a series of lines is bounded at the top and bottom by a pair of parentheses. This is known as a <em>continuation section</em>. Notice that any code after the closing parenthesis is also joined with the other lines (without any delimiter), but the opening and closing parentheses are not included.</p>
<p>If the line above the continuation section ends with a <a href="Concepts.htm#names">name</a> character and the section does not start inside a quoted string, a single space is automatically inserted to separate the name from the contents of the continuation section.</p>
<p id="continuation_quotes">Quote marks are automatically escaped (i.e. they are interpreted as literal characters) if the continuation section starts inside a quoted string, as in the examples above. Otherwise, quote marks act as they do normally; that is, continuation sections can contain expressions with quoted strings.</p>
<p id="continuation_defaults">By default, leading spaces or tabs are omitted based on the indentation of the first line inside the continuation section. If the first line mixes spaces and tabs, only the first type of character is treated as indentation. If any line is indented less than the first line or with the wrong characters, all leading whitespace on that line is left as is. </p>
<p>The default behavior of a continuation section can be overridden by including one or more of the following options to the right of the section's opening parenthesis. If more than one option is present, separate each one from the previous with a space. For example: <code>( LTrim Join|</code>.</p>
<p id="Join"><strong>Join</strong>: Specifies how lines should be connected together. If this option is omitted, each line except the last will be followed by a linefeed character (`n). If the word <em>Join</em> is specified by itself, lines are connected directly to each other without any characters in between. Otherwise, the word <em>Join</em> should be followed immediately by as many as 15 characters. For example, <code>Join`s</code> would insert a space after each line except the last. Another example is <code>Join`r`n</code>, which inserts CR+LF between lines. Similarly, <code>Join|</code> inserts  a pipe between lines. To have the final line in the section also ended by a join-string, include a blank line immediately above the section's closing parenthesis.</p>
<p id="LTrim"><strong>LTrim</strong>: Omits all spaces and tabs at the beginning of each line. This is usually unnecessary because of the <a href="#continuation_defaults">default "smart" behaviour</a>.</p>
<p id="LTrim0"><strong>LTrim0</strong> (LTrim followed by a zero): Turns off the omission of spaces and tabs from the beginning of each line.</p>
<p id="RTrim0"><strong>RTrim0</strong> (RTrim followed by a zero): Turns off the omission of spaces and tabs from the end of each line.</p>
<p id="CommentOption"><strong>Comments</strong> (or <strong>Comment</strong> or <strong>Com</strong> or <strong>C</strong>): Allows <a href="Language.htm#comments">semicolon comments</a> inside the continuation section (but not <code>/*..*/</code>). Such comments (along with any spaces and tabs to their left) are entirely omitted from the joined result rather than being treated as literal text. Each comment can appear to the right of a line or on a new line by itself.</p>
<p id="accent"><strong>`</strong> (accent): Treats each backtick character literally rather than as an <a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm">escape character</a>. This also prevents the translation of any explicitly specified escape sequences such as <code>`r</code> and <code>`t</code>.</p>
<p id="non-continuation"><strong>(</strong> or <strong>)</strong>: If an opening or closing parenthesis appears to the right of the initial opening parenthesis (except as a parameter of the <a href="#Join">Join</a> option), the line is reinterpreted as an expression instead of the beginning of a continuation section. This enables expressions like <code>(x.y)[z]()</code> to be used at the start of a line, and also allows <a href="#continuation-expr">multi-line expressions</a> to start with a line like <code>((</code> or <code>(MyFunc(</code>.</p>
<p><a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm">Escape sequences</a> such as `n (linefeed) and `t (tab) are supported inside the continuation section except when the <a href="#accent">accent (`) option</a> has been specified.</p>
<p>When the <a href="#CommentOption">comment option</a> is absent, semicolon and /*..*/ comments are not supported within the interior of a continuation section because they are seen as literal text. However, comments can be included on the bottom and top lines of the section. For example:</p>
<pre>FileAppend "   <em>; Comment.
; Comment.</em>
( LTrim Join    <em>; Comment.</em>
    &nbsp;; This is <strong>not</strong> a comment; it is literal. Include the word <i>Comments</i> in the line above to make it a comment.
)", "C:\File.txt"   <em>; Comment.</em></pre>
<p>As a consequence of the above, semicolons never need to be <a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm">escaped</a> within a continuation section.</p>
<p>Since a closing parenthesis indicates the end of a continuation section, to have a line start with literal closing parenthesis, precede it with an accent/backtick: <code>`)</code>. However, this cannot be combined with the <a href="#accent">accent (`) option</a>.</p>
<p>A continuation section can be immediately followed by a line containing the open-parenthesis of another continuation section. This allows the options mentioned above to be varied during the course of building a single line.</p>
<p>The piecemeal construction of a continuation section by means of <a href="lib/_Include.htm">#Include</a> is not supported.</p>

<h2 id="lib">Script Library Folders</h2>
<p>The library folders provide a few standard locations to keep shared scripts which other scripts utilise by means of <a href="lib/_Include.htm">#Include</a>. A library script typically contains a function or class which is designed to be used and reused in this manner. Placing library scripts in one of these locations makes it easier to write scripts that can be shared with others and work across multiple setups. The library locations are:</p>
<pre><a href="Variables.htm#ScriptDir">A_ScriptDir</a> "\Lib\"  <em>; Local library.</em>
<a href="Variables.htm#MyDocuments">A_MyDocuments</a> "\AutoHotkey\Lib\"  <em>; User library.</em>
"directory-of-the-currently-running-AutoHotkey.exe\Lib\"  <em>; Standard library.</em></pre>
<p>The library folders are searched in the order shown above.</p>
<p>For example, if a script includes the line <code>#Include &lt;MyLib&gt;</code>, the program searches for a file named "MyLib.ahk" in the local library. If not found there, it searches for it in the user library, and then the standard library. If a match is still not found and the library's name contains an underscore (e.g. <code>MyPrefix_MyFunc</code>), the program searches again with just the prefix (e.g. <code>MyPrefix.ahk</code>).</p>
<p>Although by convention a library file generally contains only a single function or class of the same name as its filename, it may also contain private functions that are called only by it. However, such functions should have fairly distinct names because they will still be in the global namespace; that is, they will be callable from anywhere in the script.</p>

<h2 id="ahk2exe">Convert a Script to an EXE (Ahk2Exe)</h2>
<p>A script compiler (courtesy of fincs, with additions by TAC109) is included with the program.</p>
<p>Once a script is compiled, it becomes a standalone executable; that is, AutoHotkey.exe is not required in order to run the script. The compilation process creates an executable file which contains the following: the AutoHotkey interpreter, the script, any files it <a href="lib/_Include.htm">includes</a>, and any files it has incorporated via the <a href="lib/FileInstall.htm">FileInstall</a> function. Additional files can be included using <a href="misc/Ahk2ExeDirectives.htm">compiler directives</a>.</p>
<p>The same compiler is used for v1.1 and v2 scripts. The compiler distinguishes script versions by checking the major version of the base file supplied.</p>

<h3 id="ahk2exe-run">Running the Compiler</h3>
<p>Ahk2Exe can be used in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>GUI Interface</strong>: Run the "Convert .ahk to .exe" item in the Start Menu. (After invoking the GUI, there may be a pause before the window is shown; see <a href="#information">Background Information</a> for more details.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Right-click</strong>: Within an open Explorer window, right-click any .ahk file and select "Compile Script" (only available if the script compiler option was chosen when AutoHotkey was installed). This creates an EXE file of the same base filename as the script, which appears after a short time in the same directory. Note: The EXE file is produced using the same custom icon, .bin file and <a href="#mpress">compression</a> setting that were last saved in Method #1 above, or as specified by any relevant <a href="misc/Ahk2ExeDirectives.htm">compiler directive</a> in the script.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="ahk2exeCmd">
    <p><strong>Command Line</strong>: The compiler can be run from the command line by using the parameters shown below. If any command line parameters are used, the script is compiled immediately unless <code class="no-highlight">/gui</code> is used. All parameters are optional, except that there must be one <code class="no-highlight">/gui</code> or <code class="no-highlight">/in</code> parameter.</p>

  <li>The built-in variable <a href="Variables.htm#IsCompiled">A_IsCompiled</a> contains 1 if the script is running in compiled form. Otherwise, it is blank.</li>
  <li>When parameters are passed to Ahk2Exe, a message indicating the success or failure of the compiling process is written to stdout. Although the message will not appear at the command prompt, it can be "caught" by means such as redirecting output to a file. </li>
  <li>Additionally in the case of a failure, Ahk2Exe has exit codes indicating the kind of error that occurred. These error codes can be found at <a href="https://github.com/AutoHotkey/Ahk2Exe/blob/master/ErrorCodes.md">GitHub (ErrorCodes.md)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ahk2exe-base">Base Executable File</h3>
<p>Each compiled script .exe is based on an executable file which implements the interpreter. The base files included in the Compiler directory have the ".bin" extension; these are versions of the interpreter which do not include the capability to load external script files. Instead, the program looks for a Win32 (RCDATA) resource named "&gt;AUTOHOTKEY SCRIPT&lt;" and loads that, or fails if it is not found.</p>
<p>The standard AutoHotkey executable files can also be used as the base of a compiled script, by embedding a Win32 (RCDATA) resource with ID 1. (Additional scripts can be added with the <a href="misc/Ahk2ExeDirectives.htm#AddResource">AddResource</a> compiler directive.) This allows the compiled script .exe to be used with the <a href="#SlashScript">/script</a> switch to execute scripts other than the main embedded script. For more details, see <a href="Program.htm#embedded-scripts">Embedded Scripts</a>.</p>

<h3 id="CompilerDirectives">Script Compiler Directives</h3>
<p>Script compiler directives allow the user to specify details of how a script is to be compiled. Some of the features are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to change the version information (such as the name, description, version...).</li>
  <li>Ability to add resources to the compiled script.</li>
  <li>Ability to tweak several miscellaneous aspects of compilation.</li>
  <li>Ability to remove code sections from the compiled script and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="misc/Ahk2ExeDirectives.htm">Script Compiler Directives</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="mpress">Compressing Compiled Scripts</h3>
<p>Ahk2Exe optionally uses MPRESS or UPX freeware to compress compiled scripts. If <strong>MPRESS.exe</strong> and/or <strong>UPX.exe</strong> has been copied to the "Compiler" subfolder where AutoHotkey was installed, either can be used to compress the .exe as directed by the <code>/compress</code> parameter or the GUI setting. </p>
<p><strong>MPRESS</strong> official website (downloads and information): <a href="http://www.matcode.com/mpress.htm">http://www.matcode.com/mpress.htm</a><br>MPRESS mirror: <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/mpress/">https://www.autohotkey.com/mpress/</a></p>
<p><strong>UPX</strong> official website (downloads and information): <a href="https://upx.github.io/">https://upx.github.io/</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While compressing the script executable prevents casual inspection of the script's source code using a plain text editor like Notepad or a PE resource editor, it does not prevent the source code from being extracted by tools dedicated to that purpose.</p>

<h3 id="information">Background Information</h3>
 <p>The following folder structure is supported, where the running version of <code>Ahk2Exe.exe</code> is in the first \Compiler directory shown below:</p>
<pre class="no-highlight">\AutoHotkey 
   AutoHotkeyA32.exe 
   AutoHotkeyU32.exe
   AutoHotkeyU64.exe
   \Compiler
      Ahk2Exe.exe  <em>; the master version of Ahk2Exe</em>
      ANSI 32-bit.bin
      Unicode 32-bit.bin
      Unicode 64-bit.bin
   \AutoHotkey v2.0-a135
      AutoHotkey32.exe
      AutoHotkey64.exe
      \Compiler
   \v2.0-beta.1
      AutoHotkey32.exe
      AutoHotkey64.exe</pre>
<p>The base file search algorithm runs for a short amount of time when Ahk2Exe starts, and works as follows:</p>
<p>Qualifying AutoHotkey .exe files and all .bin files are searched for in the compiler's directory, the compiler's parent directory, and any of the compiler's sibling directories with directory names that start with <code>AutoHotkey</code> or <code>V</code>, but do not start with <code>AutoHotkey_H</code>. The selected directories are searched recursively. Any AutoHotkey.exe files found are excluded, leaving files such as AutoHotkeyA32.exe, AutoHotkey64.exe, etc. plus all .bin files found. All .exe files that are included must have a name starting with <code>AutoHotkey</code> and a file description containing the word <code>AutoHotkey</code>, and  must have a version of <code class="no-highlight">1.1.34+</code> or <code class="no-highlight">2.0-a135+</code>.</p>
<p>A version of the AutoHotkey interpreter is also needed (as a utility) for a successful compile, and one is selected using a similar algorithm. In most cases the version of the interpreter used will match the version of the base file selected by the user for the compile.</p>

<p id="defaultfile"><strong>Script Filename:</strong> This can be omitted if there are no <em>Script Parameters</em>. If omitted, it defaults to the path and name of the <a href="Variables.htm#AhkPath">AutoHotkey executable</a>, replacing ".exe" with ".ahk". For example, if you rename AutoHotkey.exe to MyScript.exe, it will attempt to load MyScript.ahk. If you run AutoHotkey32.exe without parameters, it will attempt to load AutoHotkey32.ahk.</p>
<p id="stdin">Specify an asterisk (*) for the filename to read the script text from standard input (stdin). This also puts the following into effect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="Variables.htm#InitialWorkingDir">initial working directory</a> is used as <a href="Variables.htm#ScriptDir">A_ScriptDir</a> and to locate the <a href="Scripts.htm#lib">local Lib folder</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="Variables.htm#ScriptName">A_ScriptName</a> and <a href="Variables.htm#ScriptFullPath">A_ScriptFullPath</a> both contain "*".</li>
  <li><a href="lib/_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a> is off by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an example, see <a href="lib/Run.htm#ExecScript">ExecScript()</a>.</p>
<p>If the current executable file has <a href="Program.htm#embedded-scripts">embedded scripts</a>, this parameter can be an asterisk followed by the resource name or ID of an embedded script. For compiled scripts (i.e. if an embedded script with the ID #1 exists), this parameter must be preceded by the <code>/script</code> switch.</p>
<p><strong>Script Parameters:</strong> The string(s) you want to pass into the script, with each separated from the next by one or more spaces. Any parameter that contains spaces should be enclosed in quotation marks. If you want to pass an empty string as a parameter, specify two consecutive quotation marks. A literal quotation mark may be passed in by preceding it with a backslash (\"). Consequently, any trailing slash in a quoted parameter (such as "C:\My Documents<span class="red">\"</span>) is treated as a literal quotation mark (that is, the script would receive the string C:\My Documents<span class="red">"</span>). To remove such quotes, use <code>A_Args[1] := <a href="lib/StrReplace.htm">StrReplace</a>(A_Args[1], '"')</code></p>
<p id="cmd_args">Incoming parameters, if present, are stored as an array in the built-in variable <strong>A_Args</strong>, and can be accessed using <a href="Objects.htm#Usage_Simple_Arrays">array syntax</a>. <code>A_Args[1]</code> contains the first parameter. The following example exits the script when too few parameters are passed to it:</p>
<pre>if A_Args.Length &lt; 3
{
    MsgBox "This script requires at least 3 parameters but it only received " A_Args.Length "."
    ExitApp
}</pre>
<p>If the number of parameters passed into a script varies (perhaps due to the user dragging and dropping a set of files onto a script), the following example can be used to extract them one by one:</p>
<pre>for n, param in A_Args  <em>; For each parameter:</em>
{
    MsgBox "Parameter number " n " is " param "."
}
</pre>
<p>If the parameters are file names, the following example can be used to convert them to their case-corrected long names (as stored in the file system), including complete/absolute path:</p>
<pre>for n, GivenPath in A_Args  <em>; For each parameter (or file dropped onto a script):</em>
{
    Loop Files, GivenPath, "FD"  <em>; Include files and directories.</em>
        LongPath := A_LoopFileFullPath
    MsgBox "The case-corrected long path name of file`n" GivenPath "`nis:`n" LongPath
}</pre>

<h2 id="cp">Script File Codepage</h2>
<p>In order for non-ASCII characters to be read correctly from file, the encoding used when the file was saved (typically by the text editor) must match what AutoHotkey uses when it reads the file. If it does not match, characters will be decoded incorrectly. AutoHotkey uses the following rules to decide which encoding to use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the file begins with a UTF-8 or UTF-16 (LE) byte order mark, the appropriate codepage is used and the <a href="#CPn">/CP<i>n</i></a> switch is ignored.</li>
  <li>If the <a href="#CPn">/CP<i>n</i></a> switch is passed on the command-line, codepage <i>n</i> is used. For a list of possible values, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/intl/code-page-identifiers">Code Page Identifiers</a>.</li>
  <li>In all other cases, UTF-8 is used (this default differs from AutoHotkey v1).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this applies only to script files loaded by AutoHotkey, not to file I/O within the script itself. <a href="lib/FileEncoding.htm">FileEncoding</a> controls the default encoding of files read or written by the script, while <a href="lib/IniRead.htm">IniRead</a> and <a href="lib/IniWrite.htm">IniWrite</a> always deal in UTF-16 or ANSI.</p>
<p>As all text is converted (where necessary) to the <a href="Compat.htm#Format">native string format</a>, characters which are invalid or don't exist in the native codepage are replaced with a placeholder: '&#65533;'. This should only occur if there are encoding errors in the script file or the codepages used to save and load the file don't match.</p>
<p><a href="lib/RegWrite.htm">RegWrite</a> may be used to set the default for scripts launched from Explorer (e.g. by double-clicking a file):</p>
<pre><em>; Uncomment the appropriate line below or leave them all commented to
;   reset to the default of the current build.  Modify as necessary:
; codepage := 0        ; System default ANSI codepage
; codepage := 65001    ; UTF-8
; codepage := 1200     ; UTF-16
; codepage := 1252     ; ANSI Latin 1; Western European (Windows)</em>
if (codepage != "")
    codepage := " /CP" . codepage
cmd := Format('"{1}"{2} "%1" %*', A_AhkPath, codepage)
key := "AutoHotkeyScript\Shell\Open\Command"
if A_IsAdmin    <em>; Set for all users.</em>
    RegWrite cmd, "REG_SZ", "HKCR\" key
else            <em>; Set for current user only.</em>
    RegWrite cmd, "REG_SZ", "HKCU\Software\Classes\" key</pre>
<p>This assumes AutoHotkey has already been installed. Results may be less than ideal if it has not.</p>

<h2 id="debug">Debugging a Script</h2>
<p>Built-in functions such as <a href="lib/ListVars.htm">ListVars</a> and <a href="lib/Pause.htm">Pause</a> can help you debug a script. For example, the following two lines, when temporarily inserted at carefully chosen positions, create "break points" in the script:</p>
<pre>ListVars
Pause</pre>
<p>When the script encounters these two lines, it will display the current contents of all variables for your inspection. When you're ready to resume, un-pause the script via the File or Tray menu. The script will then continue until reaching the next "break point" (if any).</p>
<p>It is generally best to insert these "break points" at positions where the active window does not matter to the script, such as immediately before a WinActivate function. This allows the script to properly resume operation when you un-pause it.</p>
<p>The following functions are also useful for debugging: <a href="lib/ListLines.htm">ListLines</a>, <a href="lib/KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a>, and <a href="lib/OutputDebug.htm">OutputDebug</a>.</p>
<p>Some common errors, such as typos and missing "global" declarations, can be detected by <a href="lib/_Warn.htm">enabling warnings</a>.</p>
<h3 id="idebug">Interactive Debugging</h3>
<p>Interactive debugging is possible with a supported <a href="AHKL_DBGPClients.htm">DBGp client</a>. Typically the following actions are possible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set and remove breakpoints on lines - pause execution when a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint">breakpoint</a> is reached.</li>
  <li>Step through code line by line - step into, over or out of functions.</li>
  <li>Inspect all variables or a specific variable.</li>
  <li>View the stack of running threads and functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this functionality is disabled for compiled scripts which are <a href="#ahk2exe-base">based on a BIN file</a>. For compiled scripts based on an EXE file, /debug must be specified after <a href="#SlashScript">/script</a>.</p>
<p>To enable interactive debugging, first launch a supported debugger client then launch the script with the <b>/Debug</b> command-line switch.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">AutoHotkey.exe /Debug[=<i>SERVER</i>:<i>PORT</i>] ...</pre>
<p><i>SERVER</i> and <i>PORT</i> may be omitted.  For example, the following are equivalent:</p>
<pre class="no-highlight">AutoHotkey /Debug "myscript.ahk"
AutoHotkey /Debug=localhost:9000 "myscript.ahk"</pre>
<p id="debug_attach">To attach the debugger to a script which is already running, send it a message as shown below:</p>
<pre>ScriptPath := "" <em>; SET THIS TO THE FULL PATH OF THE SCRIPT</em>
A_DetectHiddenWindows := true
if WinExist(ScriptPath " ahk_class AutoHotkey")
    <em>; Optional parameters:
    ;   wParam  = the IPv4 address of the debugger client, as a 32-bit integer.
    ;   lParam  = the port which the debugger client is listening on.</em>
    PostMessage DllCall("RegisterWindowMessage",  "Str", "AHK_ATTACH_DEBUGGER")
</pre>
<p>Once the debugger client is connected, it may detach without terminating the script by sending the "detach" DBGp command.</p>

<h2 id="s1">1 - The Basics</h2>
<p class="note">Before we begin our journey, let me give some advice. Throughout this tutorial you will see a lot of text and a lot of code. For optimal learning power, it is advised that you read the text and <b>try</b> the code. Then, study the code. You can copy and paste most examples on this page. If you get confused, try reading the section again.</p>

<h3 id="s11">a. Downloading and installing AutoHotkey</h3>
<p id="local_note" class="note" style="display: none">Since you're viewing this documentation locally, you've probably already installed AutoHotkey and can skip to section b.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">
  if ('file:mk:ms-its:'.indexOf(location.protocol) != -1)
    document.getElementById("local_note").removeAttribute("style");
</script>
<p>Before learning to use AutoHotkey (AHK), you will need to download it. After downloading it, you may possibly need to install it. But that depends on the version you want. For this guide we will use the Installer since it is easiest to set up.</p>

<p>Text instructions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to the AutoHotkey Homepage: <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">https://www.autohotkey.com/</a></li>
    <li>Click Download. You should be presented with an option for each major version of AutoHotkey. This documentation is for v2, so choose that option or switch to the v1 documentation.</li>
    <li>The downloaded file should be named AutoHotkey_*_setup.exe or similar. Run this and click Install.</li>
    <li>Once done, great! Continue on to section b.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="s12">b. How to create a script</h3>
<p>Once you have AutoHotkey installed, you will probably want it to do stuff. AutoHotkey is not magic, we all wish it was, but it is not. So we will need to tell it what to do. This process is called "Scripting".</p>

<p>Text instructions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Right-Click on your desktop.</li>
    <li>Find "New" in the menu.</li>
    <li>Click "AutoHotkey Script" inside the "New" menu.</li>
    <li>Give the script a new name. It must end with a .ahk extension. For example: MyScript.ahk</li>
    <li>Find the newly created file on your desktop and right-click it.</li>
    <li>Click "Edit Script".</li>
    <li>A window should have popped up, probably Notepad. If so, SUCCESS!
    <p>So now that you have created a script, we need to add stuff into the file. For a list of all built-in function and variables, see <a href="#s5">section 5</a>.</p>
    <p>Here is a very basic script containing a hotkey which types text using the <a href="lib/Send.htm">Send</a> function when the hotkey is pressed:</p>
    <pre>
^j::
{
    Send "My First Script"
}</pre>
    <p>We will get more in-depth later on. Until then, here's an explanation of the above code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>^j::</code> is the hotkey. <code>^</code> means <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <code>j</code> is the letter <kbd>J</kbd>. Anything to the <b>left</b> of <code>::</code> are the keys you need to press.</li>
        <li><code>Send "My First Script"</code> is how you <strong>send</strong> keystrokes. <code>Send</code> is the function, anything after the space inside the quotes will be typed.</li>
        <li><code>{</code> and <code>}</code> marks the start and end of the <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Save the File.</li>
    <li>Double-click the file/icon in the desktop to run it. Open notepad or (anything you can type in) and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>J</kbd>.</li>
    <li>Hip Hip Hooray! Your first script is done. Go get some reward snacks then return to reading the rest of this tutorial.</li>
</ol><p class="note">For a video instruction, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/HcgQlGeaPHw">Install and Hello World</a> on YouTube.</p>

<h3 id="s14">c. How to find the help file on your computer</h3>
<p>Downloads for v2.0-a076 and later include an offline help file in the same zip as the main program. If you manually extracted the files, the help file should be wherever you put it.</p>
<p>v2.0-beta.4 and later include an installation script. If you have used this to install AutoHotkey, the help file for each version should be in a subdirectory of the location where AutoHotkey was installed, such as "C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\v2.0-beta.7". There may also be a symbolic link named "v2" pointing to the subdirectory of the last installed version. If v1.x is installed, a help file for that version may also be present in the root directory.</p>
<p>Look for <b>AutoHotkey.chm</b> or a file that says AutoHotkey and has a yellow question mark on it.</p>
<p>If you don't need to find the file itself, there are also a number of ways to launch it:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Via the "Help" menu option in <a href="Program.htm#tray-icon">tray menu</a> of a running script.</li>
    <li>Via the "Help" menu in the <a href="Program.htm#main-window">main window</a> of a running script, or by pressing F1 while the main window is active.</li>
    <li>Via the "Help files (F1)" option in the <a href="Program.htm#dash">Dash</a>, which can be activated with the mouse or by pressing F1 while the Dash is active. The Dash can be opened via the "AutoHotkey" shortcut in the Start menu.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="s2">2 - Hotkeys &amp; Hotstrings</h2>

<p>What is a hotkey? A hotkey is a key that is hot to the touch. ... Just kidding. It is a key or key combination that the person at the keyboard presses to trigger some actions. For example:</p>
<pre>^j::
{
    Send "My First Script"
}</pre>
<p>What is a hotstring? Hotstrings are mainly used to expand abbreviations as you type them (auto-replace), they can also be used to launch any scripted action. For example:</p>
<pre>::ftw::Free the whales</pre>
<p>The difference between the two examples is that the hotkey will be triggered when you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> while the hotstring will convert your typed "ftw" into "Free the whales".</p>
<p><i>"So, how exactly does a person such as myself create a hotkey?"</i> Good question. A hotkey is created by using a single pair of colons. The key or key combo needs to go on the <b>left</b> of the <code>::</code>. And the content needs to go below, enclosed in curly brackets.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There are exceptions, but those tend to cause confusion a lot of the time. So it won't be covered in the tutorial, at least, not right now.</p>
<pre>Esc::
{
    MsgBox "Escape!!!!"
}</pre>
<p>A hotstring has a pair of colons on each side of the text you want to trigger the text replacement. While the text to replace your typed text goes on the <b>right</b> of the second pair of colons.</p>
<p>Hotstrings, as mentioned above, can also launch scripted actions. That's fancy talk for <i>"do pretty much anything"</i>. Same with hotkeys.</p>
<pre>::btw::
{
    MsgBox "You typed btw."
}</pre>
<p>A nice thing to know is that you can have many lines of code for each hotkey, hotstring, label, and a lot of other things we haven't talked about yet.</p>
<pre>^j::
{
    MsgBox "Wow!"
    MsgBox "There are"
    Run "notepad.exe"
    WinActivate "Untitled - Notepad"
    WinWaitActive "Untitled - Notepad"
    Send "7 lines{!}{Enter}"
    SendInput "inside the CTRL{+}J hotkey."
}</pre>

<h3 id="s21">a. Keys and their mysterious symbols</h3>
<p>You might be wondering <i>"How the crud am I supposed to know that ^ means <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>?!"</i>. Well, good question. To help you learn what ^ and other symbols mean, gaze upon this chart:</p>
<table class="info">
    <tr>
        <th class="center">Symbol</th>
        <th abbr="Descr">Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">#</td>
        <td><kbd>Win</kbd> (Windows logo key)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">!</td>
        <td><kbd>Alt</kbd></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">^</td>
        <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">+</td>
        <td><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">&amp;</td>
        <td>An ampersand may be used between any two keys or mouse buttons to combine them into a custom hotkey.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p><strong>(For the full list of symbols, see the <a href="Hotkeys.htm">Hotkey</a> page)</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, for a list of all/most hotkey names that can be used on the <b>left</b> side of a hotkey's double-colon, see <a href="KeyList.htm">List of Keys, Mouse Buttons, and Joystick Controls</a>.</p>
<p>You can define a custom combination of two (and only two) keys (except joystick buttons) by using <code> &amp; </code> between them. In the example below, you would hold down Numpad0 then press Numpad1 or Numpad2 to trigger one of the hotkeys:</p>

<pre>Numpad0 &amp; Numpad1::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed Numpad1 while holding down Numpad0."
}

Numpad0 &amp; Numpad2::
{
    Run "notepad.exe"
}</pre>

<p>But you are now wondering if hotstrings have any cool modifiers since hotkeys do. Yes, they do! Hotstring modifiers go between the first set of colons. For example:</p>
<pre>:*:ftw::Free the whales</pre>

<p class="note">Visit <a href="Hotkeys.htm">Hotkeys</a> and <a href="Hotstrings.htm">Hotstrings</a> for additional hotkey and hotstring modifiers, information and examples.</p>
<h3 id="s22">b. Window specific hotkeys/hotstrings</h3>

<p>Sometime you might want a hotkey or hotstring to only work (or be disabled) in a certain window. To do this, you will need to use one of the fancy commands with a # in-front of them, namely <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a>, combined with the built-in function <a href="lib/WinActive.htm">WinActive</a> or <a href="lib/WinExist.htm">WinExist</a>:</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActive(WinTitle)
#HotIf WinExist(WinTitle)</pre>
<p>This special command (technically called "directive") creates context-sensitive hotkeys and hotstrings. Simply specify a window title for <var>WinTitle</var>. But in some cases you might want to specify criteria such as HWND, group or class. Those are a bit advanced and are covered more in-depth here: <a href="misc/WinTitle.htm">The WinTitle Parameter &amp; the Last Found Window</a>.</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActive("Untitled - Notepad")
#Space::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed WIN+SPACE in Notepad."
}</pre>
<p>To turn off context sensitivity for subsequent hotkeys or hotstrings, specify #HotIf without its parameter. For example:</p><pre><em>; Untitled - Notepad</em>
#HotIf WinActive("Untitled - Notepad")
!q::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed ALT+Q in Notepad."
}

<em>; Any window that isn't Untitled - Notepad</em>
#HotIf
!q::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed ALT+Q in any window."
}
</pre>
<p>When #HotIf directives are never used in a script, all hotkeys and hotstrings are enabled for all windows.</p>
<p>The #HotIf directive is positional: it affects all hotkeys and hotstrings physically beneath it in the script, until the next #HotIf directive.</p>
<pre><em>; Notepad</em>
#HotIf WinActive("ahk_class Notepad")
#Space::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed WIN+SPACE in Notepad."
}
::msg::You typed msg in Notepad

<em>; MSPaint</em>
#HotIf WinActive("Untitled - Paint")
#Space::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed WIN+SPACE in MSPaint!"
}
::msg::You typed msg in MSPaint!</pre>
<p class="note">For more in-depth information, check out the <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> page.</p>
<h3 id="s23">c. Multiple hotkeys/hotstrings per file</h3>
<p>This, for some reason crosses some people's minds. So I'll set it clear: AutoHotkey has the ability to have <i>as many</i> hotkeys and hotstrings in one file as you want. Whether it's 1, or 3253 (or more).</p>
<pre>#i::
{
    Run "https://www.google.com/"
}

^p::
{
    Run "notepad.exe"
}

~j::
{
    Send "ack"
}

:*:acheiv::achiev
::achievment::achievement
::acquaintence::acquaintance
:*:adquir::acquir
::aquisition::acquisition
:*:agravat::aggravat
:*:allign::align
::ameria::America</pre>
<p>The above code is perfectly acceptable. Multiple hotkeys, multiple hotstrings. All in one big happy script file.</p>

<h3 id="s24">d. Examples</h3>
<pre class="NoIndent">::btw::by the way  <em>; Replaces "btw" with "by the way" as soon as you press an <a href="Hotstrings.htm#EndChars">default ending character</a>.</em></pre>
<pre class="NoIndent">:*:btw::by the way  <em>; Replaces "btw" with "by the way" without needing an ending character.</em></pre>
<pre class="NoIndent">^n::  <em>; CTRL+N hotkey</em>
{
    Run "notepad.exe"  <em>; Run Notepad when you press CTRL+N.</em>
}  <em>; This ends the hotkey. The code below this will not be executed when pressing the hotkey.</em></pre>
<pre class="NoIndent">^b::  <em>; CTRL+B hotkey</em>
{
    Send "{Ctrl down}c{Ctrl up}"  <em>; Copies the selected text. ^c could be used as well, but this method is more secure.</em>
    SendInput "[b]{Ctrl down}v{Ctrl up}[/b]" <em>; Wraps the selected text in BBCode tags to make it bold in a forum.</em>
}  <em>; This ends the hotkey. The code below this will not be executed when pressing the hotkey.</em></pre>

<h2 id="s3">3 - Sending Keystrokes</h2>
<p>So now you decided that you want to send (type) keys to a program. We can do that. Use the <a href="lib/Send.htm">Send</a> function. This function literally sends keystrokes, to simulate typing or pressing of keys.</p>
<p>But before we get into things, we should talk about some common issues that people have.</p>
<p>Just like hotkeys, the Send function has special keys too. <a href="lib/Send.htm">Lots and lots of them</a>. Here are the four most common symbols:</p>
<table class="info">
    <tr>
        <th class="center">Symbol</th>
        <th abbr="Descr">Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">!</td>
        <td>Sends <kbd>Alt</kbd>. For example, <code>Send "This is text!a"</code> would send the keys "This is text" and then press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. <strong>Note</strong>: <code>!A</code> produces a different effect in some programs than <code>!a</code>. This is because <code>!A</code> presses <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> and <code>!a</code> presses <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. If in doubt, use lowercase.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">+</td>
        <td>Sends <kbd>Shift</kbd>. For example, <code>Send "+abC"</code> would send the text "AbC", and <code>Send "!+a"</code> would press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>.</td>

    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">^</td>
        <td>Sends <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. For example, <code>Send "^!a"</code> would press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>, and <code>Send "^{Home}"</code> would send <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd>. <strong>Note</strong>: <code>^A</code> produces a different effect in some programs than <code>^a</code>. This is because <code>^A</code> presses <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> and <code>^a</code> presses <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. If in doubt, use lowercase.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">#</td>
        <td>Sends <kbd>Win</kbd> (the key with the Windows logo) therefore <code>Send "#e"</code> would hold down <kbd>Win</kbd> and then press <kbd>E</kbd>.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>The <a href="lib/Send.htm">gigantic table on the Send page</a> shows pretty much every special key built-in to AHK. For example: <code>{Enter}</code> and <code>{Space}</code>.</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Caution:</strong> This table <b>does not</b> apply to <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a>. Meaning, you do not wrap <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or any other key) inside curly brackets when making a hotkey.</p>
<p>An example showing what shouldn't be done to a hotkey:</p>
<pre><em>; When making a hotkey...
; WRONG</em>
{LCtrl}::
{
    Send "AutoHotkey"
}

<em>; CORRECT</em>
LCtrl::
{
    Send "AutoHotkey"
}
</pre>
<p>A common issue lots of people have is, they assume that the curly brackets are put in the documentation pages just for fun. But in fact <b>they are needed</b>. It's how AHK knows that <code>{!}</code> means "exclamation point" and not "press <kbd>Alt</kbd>". So please remember to check the table on the <a href="lib/Send.htm">Send</a> page and make sure you have your brackets in the right places. For example:</p>
<pre>Send "This text has been typed{!}" <em>; Notice the ! between the curly brackets? That's because if it wasn't, AHK would press the ALT key.</em>
</pre>
<pre><em>; Same as above, but with the ENTER key. AHK would type out "Enter" if
; it wasn't wrapped in curly brackets.</em>
Send "Multiple Enter lines have Enter been sent." <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "Multiple{Enter}lines have{Enter}been sent." <em>; CORRECT</em>
</pre>
<p>Another common issue is that people think that <b>everything</b> needs to be wrapped in brackets with the Send function. That is FALSE. If it's not in the chart, it does not need brackets. You do <b>not</b> need to wrap common letters, numbers or even some symbols such as <code>.</code> (period) in curly brackets. Also, with the Send functions you are able to send more than one letter, number or symbol at a time. So no need for a bunch of Send functions with one letter each. For example:</p>
<pre>Send "{a}"       <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "{b}"       <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "{c}"       <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "{a}{b}{c}" <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "{abc}"     <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "abc"       <em>; CORRECT</em></pre>

<p>To hold down or release a key, enclose the key name in curly brackets and then use the word UP or DOWN. For example:</p>
<pre><em>; This is how you hold one key down and press another key (or keys).
; If one method doesn't work in your program, please try the other.</em>
Send "^s"                     <em>; Both of these send CTRL+S</em>
Send "{Ctrl down}s{Ctrl up}"  <em>; Both of these send CTRL+S</em>
Send "{Ctrl down}c{Ctrl up}"
Send "{b down}{b up}"
Send "{Tab down}{Tab up}"
Send "{Up down}"  <em>; Press down the up-arrow key.</em>
Sleep 1000        <em>; Keep it down for one second.</em>
Send "{Up up}"    <em>; Release the up-arrow key.</em></pre>

<p>But now you are wondering <i>"How can I make my really long Send functions readable?"</i>. Easy. Use what is known as a continuation section. Simply specify an opening parenthesis on a new line, then your content, finally a closing parenthesis on its own line. For more information, read about <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation">Continuation Sections</a>.</p>
<pre>Send "

Apples are a fruit.
)"</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There are several different forms of Send. Each has their own special features. If one form of Send does not work for your needs, try another type of Send. Simply replace the function name "Send" with one of the following: SendText, SendInput, SendPlay, SendEvent. For more information on what each one does, <a href="lib/Send.htm">read this</a>.</p>

<h3 id="s31">a. Games </h3>
<p class="warning"><strong>This is important:</strong> A lot of games, especially modern ones, have cheat prevention software. Things like GameGuard, Hackshield, PunkBuster and several others. Not only is bypassing these systems in violation of the games policies and could get you banned, they are complex to work around.</p>
<p>If a game has a cheat prevention system and your hotkeys, hotstrings and Send functions do not work, you are out of luck. However there are methods that can increase the chance of working in some games, but there is no magical <i>"make it work in my game now!!!"</i> button. So try <b>ALL</b> of these before giving up.</p>

<p>There are also known issues with DirectX. If you are having issues and you know the game uses DirectX, try the stuff described on the <a href="FAQ.htm#games">FAQ</a> page. More DirectX issues may occur when using <a href="lib/PixelSearch.htm">PixelSearch</a>, <a href="lib/PixelGetColor.htm">PixelGetColor</a> or <a href="lib/ImageSearch.htm">ImageSearch</a>. Colors might turn out black (0x000000) no matter the color you try to get. You should also try running the game in windowed mode, if possible. That fixes some DirectX issues.</p>
<p>There is no single solution to make AutoHotkey work in all programs. If everything you try fails, it may not be possible to use AutoHotkey for your needs.</p>

<h2 id="s4">4 - Running Programs &amp; Websites</h2>
<p>To run a program such as <i>mspaint.exe, calc.exe, script.ahk</i> or even a folder, you can use the <a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> function. It can even be used to open URLs such as <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">https://www.autohotkey.com/</a> . If your computer is setup to run the type of program you want to run, it's very simple:</p>
<pre><em>; Run a program. Note that most programs will require a FULL file path:</em>
Run A_ProgramFiles "\Some_Program\Program.exe"

<em>; Run a website:</em>
Run "https://www.autohotkey.com"</pre>
<p>There are some other advanced features as well, such as command line parameters and CLSID. If you want to learn more about that stuff, visit the <a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> page. </p>
<p>Here are a few more samples:</p>
<pre><em>; Several programs do not need a full path, such as Windows-standard programs:</em>
Run "notepad.exe"
Run "mspaint.exe"

<em>; Run the "My Documents" folder using a <a href="Variables.htm#BuiltIn">built-in variable</a>:</em>
Run A_MyDocuments

<em>; Run some websites:</em>
Run "https://www.autohotkey.com"
Run "https://www.google.com"</pre>
<p class="note">For more in-depth information and examples, check out the <a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="s5">5 - Function Calls with or without Parentheses</h2>
<p>In AutoHotkey, function calls can be specified with or without parentheses. The parentheses are usually only necessary if the return value of the function is needed or the function name is not written at the start of the line.</p>
<p class="note">A list of all built-in functions can be found <a href="lib/index.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>A typical function call looks like this:</p>
<pre>Function(Parameter1, Parameter2, Parameter3) <em>; with parentheses</em>
Function Parameter1, Parameter2, Parameter3  <em>; without parentheses</em></pre>
<p>The parameters support any kind of expression; this means for example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>You can do math in them:
        <pre>SubStr(37 * 12, 1, 2)
SubStr(A_Hour - 12, 2)</pre>
    </li>
    <li>You can call another functions inside them (note that these function calls must be specified with parentheses as they are not at the start of the line):
        <pre>SubStr(A_AhkPath, InStr(A_AhkPath, "AutoHotkey"))</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Text needs to be wrapped in quotes:
        <pre>SubStr("I'm scripting, awesome!", 16)</pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The most common way assigning the return value of a function to a variable is like so:</p>
<pre><span style="color:#ff4400"><b>MyVar</b></span> := SubStr("I'm scripting, awesome!", 16)</pre>
<p class="note">This isn't the only way, but the most common. You are using <code>MyVar</code> to store the return value of the function that is to the right of the <code>:=</code> operator. See <a href="Functions.htm">Functions</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<pre><em>; These are function calls without parentheses:</em>
MsgBox "This is some text."
StrReplace Input, "AutoHotKey", "AutoHotkey"
SendInput "This is awesome{!}{!}{!}"

<em>; These are function calls with parentheses:</em>
SubStr("I'm scripting, awesome!", 16)
FileExist(VariableContainingPath)
Output := SubStr("I'm scripting, awesome!", 16)</pre>

<h3 id="s51">a. Code blocks</h3>
<p><a href="lib/Block.htm">Code blocks</a> are lines of code surrounded by little curly brackets (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>). They group a section of code together so that AutoHotkey knows it's one big family and that it needs to stay together. They are most often used with functions and control flow statements such as <a href="lib/If.htm">If</a> and <a href="lib/Loop.htm">Loop</a>. Without them, only the first line in the block is called.</p>
<p>In the following code, both lines are run only if <em>MyVar</em> equals 5:</p>
<pre>if (MyVar = 5)
{
    MsgBox "MyVar equals " MyVar "!!"
    ExitApp
}</pre>
<p>In the following code, the message box is only shown if <em>MyVar</em> equals 5. The script will always exit, even if <em>MyVar</em> <b>is not</b> 5:</p>
<pre>if (MyVar = 5)
    MsgBox "MyVar equals " MyVar "!!"
    ExitApp</pre>
<p>This is perfectly fine since the if-statement only had one line of code associated with it. It's exactly the same as above, but I outdented the second line so we know it's separated from the if-statement:</p>
<pre>if (MyVar = 5)
    MsgBox "MyVar equals " MyVar "!!"
MsgBox "We are now 'outside' of the if-statement. We did not need curly brackets since there was only one line below it."</pre>

<h2 id="s6">6 - Variables</h2>
<p><a href="Variables.htm">Variables</a> are like little post-it notes that hold some information. They can be used to store text, numbers, data from functions or even mathematical equations. Without them, programming and scripting would be much more tedious.</p>
<p>Variables can be assigned a few ways. We'll cover the most common forms. Please pay attention to the colon equal sign (<code>:=</code>).</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Text assignment</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyVar := "Text"</pre>
        <p>This is the simplest form for a variable. Simply type in your text and done. Any text needs to be in quotes.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Variable assignment</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyVar := MyVar2</pre>
        <p>Same as above, but you are assigning a value of a variable to another variable.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Number assignment</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyVar := 6 + 8 / 3 * 2 - Sqrt(9)</pre>
        <p>Thanks to expressions, you can do math!</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Mixed assignment</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyVar := "The value of 5 + " MyVar2 " is: " 5 + MyVar2</pre>
        <p>A combination of the three assignments above.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>
<p class="note">Equal signs (<b>=</b>) with a symbol in front of it such as <code>:=</code> <code>+=</code> <code>-=</code> <code>.=</code> etc. are called <b>assignment operators</b> and always require an expression.</p>

<h3 id="s62">a. Getting user input</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to have the user to choose the value of stuff. There are several ways of doing this, but the simplest way is <a href="lib/InputBox.htm">InputBox</a>. Here is a simple example on how to ask the user a couple of questions and doing some stuff with what was entered:</p>
<pre>OutputVar := InputBox("What is your first name?", "Question 1").Value
if (OutputVar = "Bill")
    MsgBox "That's an awesome name, " OutputVar "."

OutputVar2 := InputBox("Do you like AutoHotkey?", "Question 2").Value
if (OutputVar2 = "yes")
    MsgBox "Thank you for answering " OutputVar2 ", " OutputVar "! We will become great friends."
else
    MsgBox OutputVar ", That makes me sad."</pre>

<h3 id="s63">b. Other Examples?</h3>
<pre class="NoIndent">Result := <a href="lib/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a>("Would you like to continue?",, 4)
if <a href="lib/MsgBox.htm#Result">Result</a> = "No"
    return  <em>; If No, stop the code from going further.</em>
MsgBox "You pressed YES."  <em>; Otherwise, the user picked yes.</em></pre>
<pre class="NoIndent">Var := "text"  <em>; Assign some text to a variable.</em>
Num := 6  <em>; Assign a number to a variable.</em>
Var2 := Var  <em>; Assign a variable to another.</em>
Var3 .= Var  <em>; Append a variable to the end of another.</em>
Var4 += Num  <em>; Add the value of a variable to another.</em>
Var4 -= Num  <em>; Subtract the value of a variable from another.</em>
Var5 := SubStr(Var, 2, 2)  <em>; Variable inside a function.</em>
Var6 := Var "Text"  <em>; Assigns a variable to another with some extra text.</em>
MsgBox(Var)  <em>; Variable inside a function.</em>
MsgBox Var  <em>; Same as above.</em>
Var := StrSplit(Var, "x")  <em>; Variable inside a function that uses InputVar and OutputVar.</em>
if (Num = 6)  <em>; Check if a variable is equal to a number.</em>
if Num = 6  <em>; Same as above.</em>
if (Var != Num)  <em>; Check if a variable is not equal to another.</em>
if Var1 &lt; Var2  <em>; Check if a variable is lesser than another.</em></pre>
<h2 id="s7">7 - Objects</h2>
<p><a href="Objects.htm">Objects</a> are a way of organizing your data for more efficient usage. An object is basically a collection of variables. A variable that belongs to an object is known as a "property". An object might also contain items, such as array elements.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons you might want to use an object for something. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You want to have a numbered list of things, such as a grocery list (this would be referred to as an indexed array)</li>
    <li>You want to represent a grid, perhaps for a board game (this would be done with nested objects)</li>
    <li>You have a list of things where each thing has a name, such as the characteristics of a fruit (this would be referred to as an associative array)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="s71">a. Creating Objects</h3>
<p>There are a few ways to create an object, and the most common ones are listed below:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Bracket syntax (Array)</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyArray := ["one", "two", "three", 17]</pre>
        <p>This creates an <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a>, which represents a list of items, numbered 1 and up. In this example, the value <code>"one"</code> is stored at index 1, and the value <code>17</code> is stored at index 4.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Brace syntax</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Banana := {Color: "Yellow", Taste: "Delicious", Price: 3}</pre>
        <p>This creates an <i>ad hoc</i> <a href="lib/Object.htm">Object</a>. It is a quick way to create an object with a short set of known properties. In this example, the value <code>"Yellow"</code> is stored in the property <code>Color</code> and the value <code>3</code> is stored in the property <code>Price</code>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Array constructor</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyArray := Array("one", "two", "three", 17)</pre>
        <p>This is equivalent to the bracket syntax. It is actually calling the Array class, not a function.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Map constructor</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyMap := Map("^", "Ctrl", "!", "Alt")</pre>
        <p>This creates a <a href="lib/Map.htm">Map</a>, or <em>associative array</em>. In this example, the value <code>"Ctrl"</code> is associated with the key <code>"^"</code>, and the value <code>"Alt"</code> is associated with the key <code>"!"</code>. Maps are often created empty with <code>Map()</code> and later filled with items.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Other constructor</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Banana := Fruit()</pre>
        <p>Creates an object of the given class (Fruit in this case).</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="s72">b. Using Objects</h3>
<p>There are many ways to use objects, including retrieving values, setting values, adding more values, and more.</p>

<h4 id="To_set_values">To set values:</h4>
<dl>
    <dt>Bracket notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyArray[2] := "TWO"
MyMap["#"] := "Win"</pre>
        <p>Setting array elements or items in a map or collection is similar to assigning a value to a variable. Simply append bracket notation to the variable which contains the object (array, map or whatever). The index or key between the brackets is an expression, so quote marks must be used for any non-numeric literal value.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Dot notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Banana.Consistency := "Mushy"</pre>
        <p>This example assigns a new value to a property of the object contained by <em>Banana</em>. If the property doesn't already exist, it is created.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="To_retrieve_values">To retrieve values:</h4>
<dl>
    <dt>Bracket notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Value := MyMap["^"]</pre>
        <p>This example retrieves the value previously associated with (mapped to) the key <code>"^"</code>. Often the key would be contained by a variable, such as <code>MyMap[modifierChar]</code>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Dot notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Value := Banana.Color</pre>
        <p>This example retrieves the <code>Color</code> property of the object <code>Banana</code>.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="To_add_new_keys_and_values">To add new keys and values:</h4>
<dl>
    <dt>Bracket notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyMap["NewerKey"] := 3.1415</pre>
        <p>To directly add a key and value, just set a key that doesn't exist yet. However, note that when assigning to an <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a>, the index must be within the range of 1 to the array's current length. Different objects may have different requirements.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Dot notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyObject.NewProperty := "Shiny"</pre>
        <p>As mentioned above, assigning to a property that hasn't already been defined will create a new property.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>InsertAt method</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyArray.InsertAt(Index, Value1, Value2, Value3...)</pre>
        <p><a href="lib/Array.htm#InsertAt">InsertAt</a> is a method used to insert new values at a specific position within an <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a>, but other kinds of objects may also define a method by this name.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Push method</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyArray.Push(Value1, Value2, Value3...)</pre>
        <p><a href="lib/Array.htm#Push">Push</a> "appends" the values to the end of the <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> <i>MyArray</i>. It is the preferred way to add new elements to an array, since the bracket notation can't be used to assign outside the current range of values.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="To_remove_keys_and_values">To remove properties and items:</h4>
<dl>
    <dt>Delete method</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">RemovedValue := MyObject.Delete(AnyKey)</pre>
        <p><a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> and <a href="lib/Map.htm">Map</a> have a Delete method, which removes the value from the array or map. The previous value of <code>MyObject[AnyKey]</code> will be stored in <i>RemovedValue</i>. For an Array, this leaves the array element without a value and doesn't affect other elements in the array.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Pop method</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyArray.Pop()</pre>
        <p>This <a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> method removes the last element from an array and returns its value. The array's length is reduced by 1.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>RemoveAt method</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">RemovedValue := MyArray.RemoveAt(Index)</pre>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyArray.RemoveAt(Index, Length)</pre>
        <p><a href="lib/Array.htm">Array</a> has the <a href="lib/Array.htm#RemoveAt">RemoveAt</a> method, which removes an array element or range of array elements. Elements (if any) to the right of the removed elements are shifted to the left to fill the vacated space.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="s8">8 - Other Helpful Goodies</h2>
<p>We have reached the end of our journey, my good friend. I hope you have learned something. But before we go, here are some other things that I think you should know. Enjoy!</p>

<h3 id="s81">a. The mysterious square brackets</h3>
<p>Throughout the documentation, you will see these two symbols (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>) surrounding code in the yellow syntax box at the top of almost all pages. Anything inside of these brackets are <b><i>OPTIONAL</i></b>. Meaning the stuff inside can be left out if you don't need them. When writing your code, it is very important to <b>NOT</b> type the square brackets in your code.</p>
<p>On the <a href="lib/ControlGetText.htm">ControlGetText</a> page you will see this:</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Text := <span class="func">ControlGetText</span>(Control <span class="optional">, WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</span>)</pre>
<p>So you could simply do this if you wanted:</p>
<pre>Text := ControlGetText(Control)</pre>
<p>Or add in some more details:</p>
<pre>Text := ControlGetText(Control, WinTitle)</pre>
<p>What if you wanted to use <em>ExcludeTitle</em> but not fill in <em>WinText</em> or <em>WinTitle</em>? Simple!</p>
<pre>Text := ControlGetText(Control,,, ExcludeTitle)</pre>
<p>Please note that you cannot IGNORE parameters, but you can leave them blank. If you were to ignore <code>WinTitle, WinText</code>, it would look like this and cause issues:</p>
<pre>Text := ControlGetText(Control, ExcludeTitle)</pre>

<h3 id="s82">b. Finding your AHK version</h3>
<p>Run this code to see your AHK version:</p>
<pre>MsgBox A_AhkVersion</pre>
<p>Or look for "AutoHotkey Help File" or "AutoHotkey.chm" in the start menu or your installation directory.</p>

<h3 id="s83">c. Trial and Error</h3>
<p>Trial and Error is a very common and effective way of learning. Instead of asking for help on every little thing, sometimes spending some time alone (sometimes hours or days) and trying to get something to work will help you learn faster.</p>
<p>If you try something and it gives you an error, study that error. Then try to fix your code. Then try running it again. If you still get an error, modify your code some more. Keep trying and failing until your code fails no more. You will learn a lot this way by reading the documentation, reading errors and learning what works and what doesn't. Try, fail, try, fail, try, try, try, fail, fail, <b>succeed!</b></p>
<p>This is how a lot of "pros" have learned. But don't be afraid to ask for help, we don't bite (hard). Learning takes time, the "pros" you encounter did not learn to be masters in just a few hours or days.</p>
<p class="note">"If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again." - Hickson, William E.</p>
<h3 id="s84">d. Indentation</h3>
<p>This stuff (indentation) is very important! Your code will run perfectly fine without it, but it will be a major headache for you and other to read your code. Small code (25 lines or less) will probably be fine to read without indentation, but it'll soon get sloppy. It's best you learn to indent ASAP. Indentation has no set style, but it's best to keep everything consistent.</p>
<p>"<b>What is indentation?</b>" you ask? It's simply spacing to break up your code so you can see what belongs to what. People usually use 3 or 4 spaces or 1 tab per "level".</p>
<p>Not indented:</p>
<pre>if (car = "old")
{
MsgBox "The car is really old."

<h1>Changes from v1.0 to v1.1</h1>

<p>This document details changes between AutoHotkey v1.0 and v1.1 that may cause scripts to behave differently, and therefore might be important to keep in mind while reading or updating old code. See also: <a href="v2-changes.htm">Changes from v1.1 to v2.0</a>.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey v1.1 is also known as "AutoHotkey_L", while AutoHotkey v1.0 was retrospectively labelled "AutoHotkey Basic". Some older versions of AutoHotkey_L used 1.0.* version numbers, so for clarity, this document refers to the two branches of AutoHotkey by name rather than version number.</p>

<span id="Validation"></span><h2 id="Syntax_Errors">Syntax Errors</h2>
<p>Certain syntax errors which were tolerated by AutoHotkey Basic are not tolerated by AutoHotkey_L. Most such errors can be easily corrected once they are identified. Some errors are detected at load-time, and must be corrected before the script will run at all. Other errors are raised only when specific conditions are met while the script is running.</p>
<p>Error detection in v2.0 is generally more robust, and as there have been numerous changes to usage beyond just error detection and handling, the differences in error detection between v1.0 and v1.1 are not listed here. For those details, refer to the v1.1 documentation.</p>

<h2 id="FileRead">FileRead</h2>
<p><a href="lib/FileRead.htm#Binary">FileRead</a> translates text between code pages in certain common cases and therefore might output corrupt binary data. To avoid this in v2.0, add the <code>RAW</code> option or use <a href="lib/FileOpen.htm">FileOpen</a> instead.</p>

<h2 id="Names">Variable and Function Names</h2>
<p>The characters <code>[</code>, <code>]</code> and <code>?</code> are reserved for use in <a href="Language.htm#expressions">expressions</a>, so are no longer valid in variable names.  Consequently, <code>?</code> (used in <a href="Variables.htm#ternary">ternary operations</a>) no longer requires a space on either side.  Code for v1.0 which uses these characters in a variable name would have a new interpretation in v1.1, and as such might not be detected as an error.</p>
<p>Related: <a href="Language.htm#operators-for-objects">Operators for Objects</a>, <a href="v2-changes.htm#names">Names (Changes from v1.1 to v2.0)</a></p>

<h2 id="DPIScale">DPI Scaling</h2>
<p><a href="lib/Gui.htm#DPIScale">DPI scaling</a> is enabled by default for script GUIs to ensure they scale according to the <a href="Variables.htm#ScreenDPI">system DPI setting</a>.  If enabled and the system DPI setting is not 96 (100%), positions and sizes accepted by or returned from Gui methods/properties are not compatible with other functions.  To disable DPI scaling, use <code>MyGui.Opt("-DPIScale")</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Transform">Transform</h2>
<p>Some <i>Transform</i> sub-commands are altered or unavailable:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Transform, Unicode</code> is available only in ANSI versions of AutoHotkey. To assign Unicode text to the clipboard, use a regular assignment. See also: <a href="lib/StrPut.htm">StrPut</a>/<a href="lib/StrGet.htm">StrGet</a>.</li>
  <li><code>Transform, HTML</code> supports additional features in Unicode versions of AutoHotkey_L.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Transform</code> itself was removed in v2.0.</p>

<h2 id="Default_Script">Default Script</h2>
<p>When AutoHotkey_L is launched without specifying a script, an .ahk file is loaded by default instead of an .ini file.  The name of this file depends on the filename of the current executable.  For more details, see <a href="Scripts.htm#defaultfile">Script Filename</a>.</p>

<h2 id="SetFormat">SetFormat, Integer[Fast], H</h2>
<p>When an uppercase H is used, hexadecimal digits A-F will also be in uppercase. AutoHotkey Basic always produces lowercase digits.</p>
<p>SetFormat itself was removed in v2.0. <code>Format("0x{:x}", n)</code> produces lowercase a-f while <code>Format("0x{:X}", n)</code> produces uppercase A-F.</p>

<h2 id="LastError">A_LastError</h2>
<p>The following commands now set <a href="Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> to assist with debugging: FileAppend, FileRead, FileReadLine, FileDelete, FileCopy, FileMove, FileGetAttrib/Time/Size/Version, FileSetAttrib/Time, FileCreateDir, RegRead, RegWrite, RegDelete.  Using any of these commands causes the previous value of A_LastError to be overwritten.</p>
<p>For v2.0, A_LastError is also set by IniRead, IniWrite and IniDelete.</p>

<h2 id="MsgBox">MsgBox</h2>
<p>MsgBox in v1.0 and v1.1 had "smart comma handling" to avoid the need to escape commas in unquoted text. This handling was slightly different between the two versions, and might need to be taken into account in very rare cases while reading v1.0 code. Refer to the v1.1 documentation for details. v2.0 uses expression syntax exclusively and as such has no need for any special handling of commas.</p>

<h2 id="GuiOwner">GUI's Owner option</h2>
<p>Applying the <a href="lib/Gui.htm#Owner">+Owner</a> option to a Gui also removes the WS_CHILD style and sets the WS_POPUP style. This may break scripts which used <code>+Owner</code> to set the parent window of a Gui <em>after</em> setting the styles.</p>

<h2 id="Tilde">~Tilde and Custom Combination Hotkeys</h2>
<p>As of v1.1.14, the <a href="Hotkeys.htm#Tilde">tilde prefix</a> affects how a key works when used as a modifier key in a custom combination.</p>

<h2 id="ComboUpDown">Custom Combinations and Down/Up Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Except when the tilde prefix is used, if both a key-down and a key-up hotkey are defined for a custom modifier key, they will both fire when the key is released.  For example, <code>x &amp; y::</code> causes both <code>x::</code> and <code>x up::</code> to fire when x is released, where previously <code>x::</code> never fired.</p>

<h2 id="IfIs">If <em>var</em> is <em>type</em></h2>
<p><code>If <i>var</i> is <i>type</i></code> identified certain (possibly locale-specific) non-ASCII characters as alphabetic/uppercase/lowercase by default in v1.0, whereas it did so in v1.1 only if <code>StringCaseSense, Locale</code> was used. Similarly, the <a href="lib/Is.htm">Is<em>Type</em></a> functions in v2.0 only identify non-ASCII characters as alphabetic if the second parameter is <code>"Locale"</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Window_Groups">Window Groups</h2>
<p><a href="lib/GroupActivate.htm">GroupActivate</a> sets ErrorLevel only in v1.1, not v1.0 or v2.0.</p>
<p><a href="lib/GroupAdd.htm">GroupAdd</a>'s <em>Label</em> parameter behaves differently between v1.0 and v1.1, but was removed in v2.0.</p>

<h2 id="Run">Run / RunWait</h2>
<p>AutoHotkey_L includes some enhancements to the way the <a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> and <a href="lib/Run.htm">RunWait</a> commands interpret the <em>Target</em> parameter.  This allows some things that didn't work previously, but in some very rare cases, may also affect scripts which were already working in AutoHotkey Basic.  The new behaviour is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If <i>Target</i> begins with a quotation mark, everything up to the next quotation mark is considered the action, typically an executable file.</li>
  <li>Otherwise the first substring which ends at a space and is either an existing file or ends in .exe, .bat, .com, .cmd or .hta is considered the action. This allows file types such as .ahk, .vbs or .lnk to accept parameters while still allowing "known" executables such as wordpad.exe to be launched without an absolute path as in previous versions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ControlZ">Control-Z</h2>
<p><a href="lib/LoopRead.htm">Loop Read</a> and <a href="lib/File.htm#ReadLine">File.ReadLine</a> no longer interpret the character <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> (0x1A) as an end-of-file marker.  Any <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>, even one appearing at the very end of the file, is loaded as-is.  <a href="lib/FileRead.htm">FileRead</a> already ignored this character, so is not affected by this issue.</p>

<h2 id="IsCompiled">A_IsCompiled</h2>
<p>If the script has not been compiled, <a href="Variables.htm#IsCompiled">A_IsCompiled</a> is defined even if the script has not been compiled; its value is <code>""</code> in v1.1 and <code>0</code> in v2.0. Previously it was left undefined, which meant that assignments such as <code>A_IsCompiled := 1</code> were valid if the script hadn't been compiled. Now it is treated as a read-only built-in variable in all cases.</p>

<h2 id="DllCall">DllCall</h2>
<p>When the function name given to <a href="lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> cannot be resolved, AutoHotkey_L automatically appends an "A" (ANSI) or "W" (Unicode) to the function name regardless of which DLL was specified. By contrast, AutoHotkey Basic appends the "A" suffix only for functions in User32.dll, Kernel32.dll, ComCtl32.dll, or Gdi32.dll.</p>

<h1>Changes from v1.1 to v2.0</h1>

<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<h3 id="legacy-syntax-removed">Legacy Syntax Removed</h3>
<p>Removed literal assignments: <code>var = value</code></p>
<p>Removed all legacy If statements, leaving only <code>if expression</code>, which never requires parentheses (but allows them, as in any expression).</p>
<p>Removed "command syntax". There are no "commands", only <a href="Language.htm#function-call-statements"><em>function call statements</em></a>, which are just function or method calls without parentheses. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>All former commands are now functions (excluding control flow statements).</li>
<li>All functions can be called without parentheses if the return value is not needed (but as before, parentheses cannot be omitted for calls within an expression).</li>
<li>All parameters are expressions, so all text is "quoted" and commas never need to be escaped. Currently this excludes a few directives (which are neither commands nor functions).</li>
<li>Parameters are the same regardless of parentheses; i.e. there is no output variable for the return value, so it is discarded if parentheses are omitted.</li>
<li>Normal variable references are never enclosed in percent signs (except with <a href="lib/_Include.htm">#Include</a> and <a href="lib/_DllLoad.htm">#DllLoad</a>). Use <a href="Variables.htm#concat">concatenation</a> or <a href="lib/Format.htm">Format</a> to include variables in text.</li>
<li>There is no comma between the function name and parameters, so <code>MouseGetPos(, y)</code> = <code>MouseGetPos , y</code> (x is omitted). A space or tab is required for clarity. For consistency, directives also follow the new convention (there must not be a comma between the directive name and parameter).</li>
<li>There is no percent-space prefix to force an expression. Unquoted percent signs in expressions are used only for double-derefs/dynamic references, and having an odd number of them is a syntax error.</li>
<li>Method call statements (method calls which omit parentheses) are restricted to a plain variable followed by one or more identifiers separated by dots, such as <code>MyVar.MyProperty.MyMethod "String to pass"</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The translation from v1-command to function is generally as follows (but some functions have been changed, as documented further below):</p>
<ul>
<li>If the command's first parameter is an output variable and the second parameter is not, it becomes the return value and is removed from the parameter list.</li>
<li>The remaining output variables are handled like <a href="#byref">ByRef parameters</a> (for which usage and syntax has changed), except that they permit references to writable built-in variables.</li>
<li>An exception is thrown on failure instead of setting ErrorLevel.</li>
<li>Values formerly returned via ErrorLevel are returned by other means, replaced with exceptions, superseded or simply not returned.</li>
</ul>
<p>All control flow statements also accept expressions, except where noted below.</p>
<p>All control flow statements which take parameters (currently excluding the two-word Loop statements) support parentheses around their parameter list, without any space between the name and parenthesis. For example, <code>return(var)</code>. However, these are not functions; for instance, <code>x := return(y)</code> is not valid. <a href="lib/If.htm">If</a> and <a href="lib/While.htm">While</a> already supported this.</p>
<p><a href="#loop-sub-commands">Loop</a> (except <a href="lib/Loop.htm">Loop <em>Count</em></a>) is now followed by a secondary keyword (Files, Parse, Read or Reg) which cannot be "quoted" or contained by a variable. Currently the keyword can be followed by a comma, but it is not required as this is not a parameter. OTB is supported by all modes.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Goto.htm">Goto</a>, <a href="lib/Break.htm">break</a> and <a href="lib/Continue.htm">continue</a> require an unquoted label name, similar to v1 (<code>goto label</code> jumps to <code>label:</code>). To jump to a label dynamically, use parentheses immediately after the name: <code>goto(expression)</code>. However, this is not a function and cannot be used mid-expression. Parentheses can be used with break or continue, but in that case the parameter must be a single literal number or quoted string.</p>
<p>Gosub has been removed, and labels can no longer be used with functions such as <a href="lib/SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a> and <a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>They were redundant; basically just a limited form of function, without local variables or a return value, and being in their own separate namespace. Functions can be used everywhere that label subroutines were used before (even <a href="Functions.htm#nested">inside other functions</a>).</li>
<li>Functions cannot overlap (but can be contained within a function). Instead, use multiple functions and call one from the other. Instead of A_ThisLabel, use function parameters.</li>
<li>Unlike subroutines, if one forgets to define the <em>end</em> of a function, one is usually alerted to the error as each <code>{</code> must have a corresponding <code>}</code>. It may also be easier to identify the bounds of a function than a label subroutine.</li>
<li>Functions can be placed in the auto-execute section without interrupting it. The auto-execute section can now easily span the entire script, so may instead be referred to as <a href="Language.htm#global-code">global code</a>, executing within the <a href="Scripts.htm#auto">auto-execute thread</a>.</li>
<li>Functions might be a little less prone to being misused as "goto" (where a user gosubs the current subroutine in order to loop, inevitably exhausting stack space and terminating the program).</li>
<li>There is less ambiguity without functions (like <a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a>) accepting a label or a function, where both can exist with the same name at once.</li>
<li>For all remaining uses of labels, it is not valid to refer to a global label from inside a function. Therefore, label lookup can be limited to the local label list. Therefore, there is no need to check for invalid jumps from inside a function to outside (which were never supported).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hotkey-and-hotstring-labels">Hotkey and Hotstring Labels</h3>
<p><a href="Hotkeys.htm">Hotkeys</a> and non-autoreplace <a href="Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a> are no longer labels; instead, they (automatically) define a function. For multi-line hotkeys, use braces to enclose the body of the hotkey instead of terminating it with <code>return</code> (which is implied by the ending brace). To allow a hotkey to be called explicitly, specify <code>funcName(ThisHotkey)</code> between the <code>::</code> and <code>{</code> - this can also be done in v1.1.20+, but now there is a parameter. When the function definition is not explicit, the parameter is named ThisHotkey.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Hotkey functions are <a href="Functions.htm#AssumeLocal">assume-local</a> by default and therefore cannot assign to <a href="Functions.htm#Global">global variables</a> without a declaration.</p>
<h3 id="names">Names</h3>
<p>Function and variable names are now placed in a shared namespace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each function definition creates a constant (read-only variable) within the current scope.</li>
<li>Use <code>MyFunc</code> in place of <code>Func("MyFunc")</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>MyFunc</code> in place of <code>"MyFunc"</code> when passing the function to any built-in function such as <a href="lib/SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a> or <a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a>. Passing a name (string) is no longer supported.</li>
<li>Use <code>myVar()</code> in place of <code>%myVar%()</code> when calling a function by value.</li>
<li>To call a function when all you have is a function name (string), first use a <a href="Variables.htm#deref">double-deref</a> to resolve the name to a variable and retrieve its value (the function object). <code>%myVar%()</code> now actually performs a double-deref and then calls the result, equivalent to <code>f := %myVar%, f()</code>. Avoid handling functions by name (string) where possible; use references instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Names cannot start with a digit and cannot contain the following characters which were previously allowed: <code>@ # $</code>.  Only letters, numbers, underscore and non-ASCII characters are allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Reserved words:</strong> Declaration keywords and names of control flow statements cannot be used as variable, function or class names. This includes <code class="no-highlight">local</code>, <code class="no-highlight">global</code>, <code class="no-highlight">static</code>, <code class="no-highlight">if</code>, <code class="no-highlight">else</code>, <code class="no-highlight">loop</code>, <code class="no-highlight">for</code>, <code class="no-highlight">while</code>, <code class="no-highlight">until</code>, <code class="no-highlight">break</code>, <code class="no-highlight">continue</code>, <code class="no-highlight">goto</code>, <code class="no-highlight">return</code>, <code class="no-highlight">switch</code>, <code class="no-highlight">case</code>, <code class="no-highlight">try</code>, <code class="no-highlight">catch</code>, <code class="no-highlight">finally</code> and <code class="no-highlight">throw</code>. The purpose of this is primarily to detect errors such as <code>if (ex) break</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Reserved words:</strong> <code class="no-highlight">as</code>, <code class="no-highlight">and</code>, <code class="no-highlight">contains</code>, <code class="no-highlight">false</code>, <code class="no-highlight">in</code>, <code class="no-highlight">is</code>, <code class="no-highlight">IsSet</code>, <code class="no-highlight">not</code>, <code class="no-highlight">or</code>, <code class="no-highlight">super</code>, <code class="no-highlight">true</code>, <code class="no-highlight">unset</code>. These words are reserved for future use or other specific purposes, and are not permitted as variable or function names even when unambiguous. This is primarily for consistency: in v1, <code>and := 1</code> was allowed on its own line but <code>(and := 1)</code> would not work.</p>
<p>The words listed above are permitted as property or window group names. Property names in typical use are preceded by <code>.</code>, which prevents the word from being interpreted as an operator. By contrast, keywords are never interpreted as variable or function names within an expression. For example, <code>not(x)</code> is equivalent to <code>not (x)</code> or <code>(not x)</code>.</p>
<p>A number of classes are predefined, effectively reserving those global variable names in the same way that a user-defined class would. (However, the <a href="#scope">changes to scope</a> described below mitigate most issues arising from this.) For a list of classes, see <a href="ObjList.htm">Built-in Classes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
<p><em>Super-global</em> variables have been removed (excluding built-in variables, which aren't quite the same as they cannot be redeclared or shadowed).</p>
<p>Within an <a href="Functions.htm#AssumeLocal">assume-local</a> function, if a given name is not used in a declaration or as the target of a non-dynamic assignment or the <a href="Variables.htm#ref">reference (&amp;) operator</a>, it may resolve to an existing global variable.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions can now read global variables without declaring them.</li>
<li>Functions which have no <code>global</code> declarations cannot directly modify global variables (eliminating one source of unintended side-effects).</li>
<li>Adding a new <code>class</code> to the script is much less likely to affect the behaviour of any existing function, as classes are not super-global.</li>
<li>The <code>global</code> keyword is currently redundant when used in global scope, but can be used for clarity. Variables declared this way are now much less likely to conflict with local variables (such as when combining scripts manually or with <a href="lib/_Include.htm">#Include</a>), as they are not super-global. On the other hand, some convenience is lost.</li>
<li>Declarations are generally not needed as much.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Force-local</em> mode has been removed.</p>
<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
<p>Local <a href="Functions.htm#static">static</a> variables are initialized if and when execution reaches them, instead of being executed in linear order before the auto-execute section begins. Each initializer has no effect the second time it is reached. Multiple declarations are permitted and may execute for the same variable at different times. There are multiple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a static initializer calls other functions with static variables, there is less risk of initializers having not executed yet due to the order of the function definitions.</li>
<li>Because the function has been called, parameters, <a href="Variables.htm#ThisFunc">A_ThisFunc</a> and closures are available (they previously were not).</li>
<li>A static variable can be initialized conditionally, adding flexibility, while still only executing once without requiring <code>if IsSet()</code>.</li>
<li>Since there may be multiple initializers for a single static variable, compound assignments such as <code>static x += 1</code> are permitted. (This change reduced code size marginally as it was already permitted by <code>local</code> and <code>global</code>.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>static init := somefunction()</code> can no longer be used to auto-execute <em>somefunction</em>. However, since label-and-return based subroutines can now be completely avoided, the auto-execute section is able to span the entire script.</p>
<p>Declaring a variable with <code>local</code> no longer makes the function <a href="Functions.htm#AssumeGlobal">assume-global</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Variables.htm#deref">Double-derefs</a> are now more consistent with variables resolved at load-time, and are no longer capable of creating new variables. This avoids some inconsistencies and common points of confusion.</p>
<p>Double-derefs which fail for any reason now cause an error to be thrown. Previously any cases with an invalid name would silently produce an empty string, while other cases would create and return an empty variable.</p>
<h3 id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
<p>Quoted literal strings can be written with <code>"double"</code> or <code>'single'</code> quote marks, but must begin and end with the same mark. Literal quote marks are written by preceding the mark with an escape character - <code>`"</code> or <code>`'</code> - or by using the opposite type of quote mark: <code>'"42" is the answer'</code>. Doubling the quote marks has no special meaning, and causes an error since auto-concat requires a space.</p>
<p>The operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> yield whichever value determined the result, similar to JavaScript and Lua. For example, <code>"" or "default"</code> yields <code>"default"</code> instead of <code>1</code>. Scripts which require a pure boolean value (0 or 1) can use something like <code>!!(x or y)</code> or <code>(x or y) ? 1 : 0</code>.</p>
<p>Auto-concat now requires at least one space or tab in all cases (the v1 documentation says there "should be" a space).</p>
<p>The result of a multi-statement expression such as <code>x(), y()</code> is the last (right-most) sub-expression instead of the first (left-most) sub-expression. In both v1 and v2, the sub-expressions are evaluated in left to right order.</p>
<p>Equals after a comma is no longer assignment: <code>y=z</code> in <code>x:=y, y=z</code> is an ineffectual comparison instead of an assignment.</p>
<p><code>:= += -= *= /= ++ --</code> have consistent behaviour regardless of whether they are used on their own or combined with other operators, such as with <code>x := y, y += 2</code>. Previously, there were differences in behaviour when an error occurred within the expression or a blank value was used in a math operation.</p>
<p><code>!=</code> is now always case-insensitive, like <code>=</code>, while <code>!==</code> has been added as the counterpart of <code>==</code>.</p>
<p><code>&lt;&gt;</code> has been removed.</p>
<p><code>//</code> now throws an exception if given a floating-point number. Previously the results were inconsistent between negative floats and negative integers.</p>
<p><code>|</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> now throw an exception if given a floating-point number, instead of truncating to integer.</p>
<p>Scientific notation can be used without a decimal point (but produces a floating-point number anyway). Scientific notation is also supported when numeric strings are converted to integers (for example, "1e3" is interpreted as 1000 instead of 1).</p>
<p>Function calls now permit virtually any sub-expression for specifying which function to call, provided that there is no space or tab before the open-parenthesis of the parameter list. For example, <code>MyFunc()</code> would call the value <code>MyFunc</code> regardless of whether that is the function's actual name or a variable containing a function object, and <code>(a?b:c)()</code> would call either <code>b</code> or <code>c</code> depending on <code>a</code>. Note that <code>x.y()</code> is still a method call roughly equivalent to <code>(x.y)(x)</code>, but <code>a[i]()</code> is now equivalent to <code>(a[i])()</code>.</p>
<p>Double-derefs now permit almost any expression (not just variables) as the source of the variable name. For example, <code>DoNotUseArray%n+1%</code> and <code>%(%triple%)%</code> are valid. Double-deref syntax is now also used to dereference VarRefs, such as <code>ref := &amp;var, value := %ref%</code>.</p>
<p>The expressions <code>funcName[""]()</code> and <code>funcName.()</code> no longer call a function by name. Omitting the method name as in <code>.()</code> now causes a load-time error message. Functions should be called or handled by reference, not by name.</p>
<p><code>var :=</code> with no r-value is treated as an error at load-time. In v1 it was equivalent to <code>var := ""</code>, but silently failed if combined with another expression - for example: <code>x :=, y :=</code>.</p>
<p>Where a literal string is followed by an ambiguous unary/binary operator, an error is reported at load-time. For instance, <code>"new counter:" ++counter</code> is probably supposed to increment and display <code>counter</code>, but technically it is invalid <em>addition</em> and <em>unary plus</em>.</p>
<p><code>word ++</code> and <code>word --</code> are no longer expressions, since <code>word</code> can be a user-defined function (and ++/- may be followed by an expression which produces a variable reference).  To write a standalone post-increment or post-decrement expression, either omit the space between the variable and the operator, or wrap the variable or expression in parentheses.</p>
<p><code>word ? x : y</code> is still a ternary expression, but more complex cases starting with a word, such as <code>word1 word2 ? x : y</code>, are always interpreted as function calls to <em>word1</em> (even if no such function exists). To write a standalone ternary expression with a complex condition, enclose the condition in parentheses.</p>
<p>The new <a href="Variables.htm#is"><code>is</code> operator</a> such as in <code>x is y</code> can be used to check whether value <em>x</em> is an instance of class <em>y</em>, where <em>y</em> must be an Object with a <code>prototype</code> property (i.e. a Class). This includes primitive values, as in <code>x is Integer</code> (which is strictly a type check, whereas <code>IsInteger(x)</code> checks for potential conversion).</p>
<p>Keywords <code>contains</code> and <code>in</code> are reserved for future use.</p>
<p><code>&amp;var</code> (address-of) has been replaced with <code>StrPtr(var)</code> and <code>ObjPtr(obj)</code> to more clearly show the intent and enhance error checking. In v1, address-of returned the address of <em>var</em>'s internal string buffer, even if it contained a number (but not an object). It was also used to retrieve the address of an object, and getting an address of the wrong type can have dire consequences.</p>
<p><code>&amp;var</code> is now the <a href="Variables.htm#ref">reference operator</a>, which is used with all <a href="#byref">ByRef</a> and OutputVar parameters to improve clarity and flexibility (and make other language changes possible). See <a href="Concepts.htm#variable-references">Variable References (VarRef)</a> for more details.</p>
<p>String length is now cached during expression evaluation. This improves performance and allows strings to contain binary zero. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concatenation of two strings where one or both contain binary zero no longer causes truncation of the data.</li>
<li>The case-sensitive equality operators (<code>==</code> and <code>!==</code>) can be used to compare binary data. The other comparison operators only "see" up to the first binary zero.</li>
<li>Binary data can be returned from functions and assigned to objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most functions still expect null-terminated strings, so will only "see" up to the first binary zero. For example, <a href="lib/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a> would display only the portion of the string before the first binary zero.</p>
<p>The <code>*</code> (deref) operator has been removed. Use <a href="lib/NumGet.htm">NumGet</a> instead.</p>
<p>The <code>~</code> (<a href="Variables.htm#unary">bitwise-NOT</a>) operator now always treats its input as a 64-bit signed integer; it no longer treats values between 0 and 4294967295 as unsigned 32-bit.</p>
<p><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;=</code> have been added for logical right bit shift.</p>
<p>Added <a href="Variables.htm#fat-arrow">fat arrow functions</a>. The expression <code>Fn(Parameters) =&gt; Expression</code> defines a function named <em>Fn</em> (which can be blank) and returns a <a href="lib/Func.htm">Func</a> or Closure object. When called, the function evaluates <em>Expression</em> and returns the result. When used inside another function, <em>Expression</em> can refer to the outer function's variables (this can also be done with a normal function definition).</p>
<p>The fat arrow syntax can also be used to define methods and property getters/setters (in which case the method/property definition itself isn't an expression, but its body just returns an expression).</p>
<p>Literal numbers are now fully supported on the left-hand side of member access (dot). For example, <code>0.1</code> is a number but <code>0.min</code> and <code>0.1.min</code> access the <em>min</em> property which can be handled by a base object (see <a href="Objects.htm#primitive">Primitive Values</a>). <code>1..2</code> or <code>1.0.2</code> is the number 1.0 followed by the property 2. Example use might be to implement units of measurement, literal version numbers or ranges.</p>
<p><code>x**y</code>: Where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are integers and <code>y</code> is positive, the power operator now gives correct results for all inputs if in range, where previously some precision was lost due to the internal use of floating-point math. Behaviour of overflow is undefined.</p>
<h3 id="objects-misc">Objects (Misc)</h3>
<p>See also: <a href="#objects">Objects</a></p>
<p>There is now a distinction between properties accessed with <code>.</code> and data (items, array or map elements) accessed with <code>[]</code>. For example, <code>dictionary["Count"]</code> can return the definition of "Count" while <code>dictionary.Count</code> returns the number of words contained within. User-defined objects can utilize this by defining an <a href="Objects.htm#__Item">__Item property</a>.</p>
<p>When the name of a property or method is not known in advance, it can (and must) be accessed by using percent signs. For example, <code>obj.%varname%()</code> is the v2 equivalent of <code>obj[varname]()</code>. The use of <code>[]</code> is reserved for data (such as array elements).</p>
<p>The literal syntax for constructing an ad hoc object is still basically <code>{name: value}</code>, but since plain objects now only have "properties" and not "array elements", the rules have changed slightly for consistency with how properties are accessed in other contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>o := {a: b}</code> uses the name "a", as before.</li>
<li><code>o := {%a%: b}</code> uses the property name in <code>a</code>, instead of taking that as a variable name, performing a double-deref, and using the contents of the resulting variable. In other words, it has the same effect as <code>o := {}, o.%a% := b</code>.</li>
<li>Any other kind of expression to the left of <code>:</code> is illegal. For instance, <code>{(a): b}</code> or <code>{an error: 1}</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of the word "base" in <code>base.Method()</code> has been replaced with <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_super">super</a> (<code>super.Method()</code>) to distinguish the two concepts better:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>super.</code> or <code>super[</code> calls the super-class version of a method/property, where "super-class" is the base of the prototype object which was originally associated with the current function's definition.</li>
<li><code>super</code> is a reserved word; attempting to use it without the <code>.</code> or <code>[</code> or <code>(</code> suffix or outside of a class results in a load time error.</li>
<li><code>base</code> is a pre-defined property which gets or sets the object's immediate base object (like <a href="lib/Any.htm#GetBase">ObjGetBase</a>/<a href="lib/Object.htm#SetBase">ObjSetBase</a>). It is just a normal property name, not reserved.</li>
<li>Invoking <code>super.x</code> when the superclass has no definition of x throws an error, whereas <code>base.x</code> was previously ignored (even if it was an assignment).</li>
</ul>
<p>Where Fn is an object, <code>Fn()</code> (previously written as <code>%Fn%()</code>) now calls <code>Fn.Call()</code> instead of <code>Fn.()</code> (which can now only be written as <code>Fn.%""%()</code>). Functions no longer support the nameless method.</p>
<p><code>this.Method()</code> calls <code>Fn.Call(this)</code> (where <em>Fn</em> is the function object which implements the method) instead of <code>Fn[this]()</code> (which in v1, would result in a call to <code>Fn.__Call(this)</code> unless <code>Fn[this]</code> contains a function). Function objects should implement a <em>Call</em> method instead of <em>__Call</em>, which is only for explicit method calls.</p>
<p><code><i>Classname</i>()</code> (formerly <code>new <i>Classname</i>()</code>) now fails to create the object if the <code>__New</code> method is defined and it could not be called (e.g. because the parameter count is incorrect), or if parameters were passed and <code>__New</code> is not defined.</p>
<p>Objects created within an expression or returned from a function are now held until expression evaluation is complete, and then released.  This improves performance slightly and allows temporary objects to be used for memory management within an expression, without fear of the objects being freed prematurely.</p>
<p>Objects can contain string values (but not keys) which contain binary zero. Cloning an object preserves binary data in strings, up to the stored length of the string (not its capacity). Historically, data was written beyond the value's length when dealing with binary data or structs; now, a <a href="lib/Buffer.htm">Buffer</a> object should be used instead.</p>
<p>Assignment expressions such as <code>x.y := z</code> now always yield the value of <code>z</code>, regardless of how <code>x.y</code> is implemented. The return value of a property setter is now ignored. Previously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some built-in objects returned <code>z</code>, some returned <code>x.y</code> (such as <code>c := GuiObj.BackColor := "red"</code> setting <code>c</code> to <code>0xFF0000</code>), and some returned an incorrect value.</li>
<li>User-defined property setters may have returned unexpected values or failed to return anything.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>x.y(z) := v</code> is now a syntax error. It was previously equivalent to <code>x.y[z] := v</code>. In general, <code>x.y(z)</code> (method call) and <code>x.y[z]</code> (parameterized property)  are two different operations, although they may be equivalent if <code>x</code> is a COM object (due to limitations of the COM interface).</p>
<p>Concatenating an object with another value or passing it to Loop is currently treated as an error, whereas previously the object was treated as an empty string. This may be changed to implicitly call <code>.ToString()</code>. Use <code>String(x)</code> to convert a value to a string; this calls <code>.ToString()</code> if <code>x</code> is an object.</p>
<p>When an object is called via IDispatch (the COM interface), any uncaught exceptions which cannot be passed back to the caller will cause an error dialog. (The caller may or may not show an additional error dialog without any specific details.) This also applies to event handlers being called due to the use of <a href="lib/ComObjConnect.htm">ComObjConnect</a>.</p>
<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>Functions can no longer be dynamically called with more parameters than they formally accept.</p>
<p>Variadic functions are not affected by the above restriction, but normally will create an array each time they are called to hold the surplus parameters. If this array is not needed, the parameter name can now be omitted to prevent it from being created:</p>
<pre>AcceptsOneOrMoreArgs(first, *) {
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>This can be used for callbacks where the additional parameters are not needed.</p>
<p>Variadic function calls now permit any enumerable object, where previously they required a standard Object with sequential numeric keys. If the enumerator returns more than one value per iteration, only the first value is used. For example, <code>Array(mymap*)</code> creates an array containing the keys of <em>mymap</em>.</p>
<p>Variadic function calls previously had half-baked support for named parameters. This has been disabled, to remove a possible impediment to the proper implementation of named parameters.</p>
<p>User-defined functions may use the new keyword <code>unset</code> as a parameter default value to make the parameter "unset" when no value was provided. The function can then use IsSet() to determine if a value was provided. <code>unset</code> is currently not permitted in any other context.</p>
<p>Scripts are no longer automatically included from the function library (Lib) folders when a function call is present without a definition, due to increased complexity and potential for accidents (now that the <code>MyFunc</code> in <code>MyFunc()</code> can be any variable). <code>#Include &lt;LibName&gt;</code> works as before. It may be superseded by module support in a future release.</p>
<p>Variadic built-in functions now have a <code>MaxParams</code> value equal to <code>MinParams</code>, rather than an arbitrary number (such as 255 or 10000). Use <code>IsVariadic</code> to detect when there is no upper bound.</p>
<h4 id="byref">ByRef</h4>
<p><a href="Functions.htm#ByRef">ByRef parameters</a> are now declared using <code>&amp;param</code> instead of <code>ByRef param</code>, with some differences in usage.</p>
<p>ByRef parameters no longer implicitly take a reference to the caller's variable. Instead, the caller must explicitly pass a reference with the <a href="Variables.htm#ref">reference operator</a> (<code>&amp;var</code>). This allows more flexibility, such as storing references elsewhere, accepting them with a variadic function and passing them on with a variadic call.</p>
<p>When a parameter is marked ByRef, any attempt to explicitly pass a non-VarRef value causes an error to be thrown. Otherwise, the function can check for a reference with <code>param is VarRef</code>, check if the target variable has a value with <code>IsSetRef(param)</code>, and explicitly dereference it with <code>%param%</code>.</p>
<p>ByRef parameters are now able to receive a reference to a local variable from a previous instance of the same function, when it is called recursively.</p>
<h3 id="nested-functions">Nested Functions</h3>
<p>One function may be defined inside another. A nested function may automatically "capture" non-static local variables from the enclosing function (under the right conditions), allowing them to be used after the enclosing function returns.</p>
<p>The new "fat arrow" <code>=&gt;</code> operator can also be used to create nested functions.</p>
<p>For full detail, see <a href="Functions.htm#nested">Nested Functions</a>.</p>
<h3 id="uncategorized">Uncategorized</h3>
<p><code>:=</code> must be used in place of <code>=</code> when initializing a declared variable or optional parameter.</p>
<p><code>return %var%</code> now does a double-deref; previously it was equivalent to <code>return var</code>.</p>
<p><a href="lib/_Include.htm">#Include</a> is relative to the directory containing the current file by default. Its parameter may now optionally be enclosed in quote marks.</p>
<p><a href="lib/_ErrorStdOut.htm">#ErrorStdOut</a>'s parameter may now optionally be enclosed in quote marks.</p>
<p>Label names are now required to consist only of letters, numbers, underscore and non-ASCII characters (the same as variables, functions, etc.).</p>
<p>Labels defined in a function have local scope; they are visible only inside that function and do not conflict with labels defined elsewhere. It is not possible for local labels to be called externally (even by built-in functions). Nested functions can be used instead, allowing full use of local variables.</p>
<p><code>for k, v in obj</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the object is invoked has changed. See <em>Enumeration</em>.</li>
<li><code>for</code> now restores k and v to the values they had before the loop began, after the loop breaks or completes.</li>
<li>An exception is thrown if <em>obj</em> is not an object or there is a problem retrieving or calling its enumerator.</li>
<li>Up to 19 variables can be used.</li>
<li>Variables can be omitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Escaping a comma no longer has any meaning. Previously if used in an expression within a command's parameter and not within parentheses, it forced the comma to be interpreted as the multi-statement operator rather than as a delimiter between parameters. It only worked this way for commands, not functions or variable declarations.</p>
<p>The escape sequence <code>`s</code> is now allowed wherever <code>`t</code> is supported. It was previously only allowed by #IfWin and (Join.</p>
<p><code>*/</code> can now be placed at the end of a line to end a multi-line comment, to resolve a common point of confusion relating to how <code>/* */</code> works in other languages. Due to the risk of ambiguity (e.g. with a hotstring ending in <code>*/</code>), any <code>*/</code> which is not preceded by <code>/*</code> is no longer ignored (reversing a change made in AHK_L revision 54).</p>
<p>Integer constants and numeric strings outside of the supported range (of 64-bit signed integers) now overflow/wrap around, instead of being capped at the min/max value. This is consistent with math operators, so <code>9223372036854775807+1 == 9223372036854775808</code> (but both produce -9223372036854775808). This facilitates bitwise operations on 64-bit values.</p>
<p>For numeric strings, there are fewer cases where whitespace characters other than space and tab are allowed to precede the number. The general rule (in both v1 and v2) is that only space and tab are permitted, but in some cases other whitespace characters are tolerated due to C runtime library conventions.</p>
<p><code>else</code> can now be used with <code>loop</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code> and <code>catch</code>. For loops, it is executed if the loop had zero iterations. For <code>catch</code>, it is executed if no exception is thrown within <code>try</code> (and is not executed if any error or value is thrown, even if there is no <code>catch</code> matching the value's class). Consequently, the interpretation of <code>else</code> may differ from previous versions when used without braces. For example:</p>
<pre>if condition
{
    while condition
        <em>; statement to execute for each iteration</em>
} <em>; These braces are now required, otherwise else associates with while</em>
else
    <em>; statement to execute if condition is false</em>
</pre>
<h3 id="continuation-sections">Continuation Sections</h3>
<p>Smart LTrim: The default behaviour is to count the number of leading spaces or tabs on the first line below the continuation section options, and remove that many spaces or tabs from each line thereafter. If the first line mixes spaces and tabs, only the first type of character is treated as indentation. If any line is indented less than the first line or with the wrong characters, all leading whitespace on that line is left as is.</p>
<p>Quote marks are automatically escaped (i.e. they are interpreted as literal characters) if the continuation section starts inside a quoted string. This avoids the need to escape quote marks in multi-line strings (if the starting and ending quotes are outside the continuation section) while still allowing multi-line expressions to contain quoted strings.</p>
<p>If the line above the continuation section ends with a name character and the section does not start inside a quoted string, a single space is automatically inserted to separate the name from the contents of the continuation section. This allows a continuation section to be used for a multi-line expression following <code>return</code>, function call statements, etc. It also ensures variable names are not joined with other tokens (or names), causing invalid expressions.</p>
<p>Newline characters (<code>`n</code>) in expressions are treated as spaces. This allows multi-line expressions to be written using a continuation section with default options (i.e. omitting <code>Join</code>).</p>
<p>The <code>,</code> and <code>%</code> options have been removed, since there is no longer any need to escape these characters.</p>
<p>If <code>(</code> or <code>)</code> appears in the options of a potential continuation section (other than as part of the <code>Join</code> option), the overall line is not interpreted as the start of a continuation section. In other words, lines like <code>(x.y)()</code> and <code>(x=y) &amp;&amp; z()</code> are interpreted as expressions. A multi-line expression can also begin with an open-parenthesis at the start of a line, provided that there is at least one other <code>(</code> or <code>)</code> on the first physical line. For example, the entire expression could be enclosed with <code>((</code> ... <code>))</code>.</p>
<p>Excluding the above case, if any invalid options are present, a load-time error is displayed instead of ignoring the invalid options.</p>
<p>Lines starting with <code>(</code> and ending with <code>:</code> are no longer excluded from starting a continuation section on the basis of looking like a label, as <code>(</code> is no longer valid in a label name. This makes it possible for something like <code>(Join:</code> to start a continuation section. However, <code>(:</code> is an error and <code>(::</code> is still a hotkey.</p>
<p>A new method of line continuation is supported in expressions and function/property definitions which utilizes the fact that each <code>(</code>/<code>[</code>/<code>{</code> must be matched with a corresponding <code>)</code>/<code>]</code>/<code>}</code>. In other words, if a line contains an unclosed <code>(</code>/<code>[</code>/<code>{</code>, it will be joined with subsequent lines until the number of opening and closing symbols balances out. Brace <code>{</code> at the end of a line is considered to be one-true-brace (rather than the start of an object literal) if there are no other unclosed symbols and the brace is not immediately preceded by an operator.</p>
<h3 id="continuation-lines">Continuation Lines</h3>
<p>Line continuation is now more selective about the context in which a symbol is considered an expression operator. In general, comma and expression operators can no longer be used for continuation in a textual context, such as with hotstrings or directives (other than #HotIf), or after an unclosed quoted string.</p>
<p>Line continuation now works for expression operators at the end of a line.</p>
<p><code>is</code>, <code>in</code> and <code>contains</code> are usable for line continuation, though <code>in</code> and <code>contains</code> are still reserved/not yet implemented as operators.</p>
<p><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>is</code>, <code>in</code> and <code>contains</code> act as line continuation operators even if followed by an assignment or other binary operator, since these are no longer valid variable names. By contrast, v1 had exceptions for <code>and</code>/<code>or</code> followed by any of: <code>&lt;&gt;=/|^:,</code></p>
<p>When <code>.</code> is used for continuation, the two lines are no longer automatically delimited by a space if there was no space or tab to the right of <code>.</code> at the start of a line, as in <code>.VeryLongNestedClassName</code>. Note that <code>x .123</code> is always property access (not auto-concat) and <code>x+.123</code> works with or without space.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types</h3>
<p>In general, v2 produces more consistent results with any code that depends on the type of a value.</p>
<p>In v1, a variable can contain both a string and a cached binary number, which is updated whenever the variable is used as a number.  Since this cached binary number is the only means of detecting the type of value, caching performed internally by expressions like <code>var+1</code> or <code>abs(var)</code> effectively changes the "type" of <code>var</code> as a side-effect. v2 disables this caching, so that <code>str := "123"</code> is always a string and <code>int := 123</code> is always an integer. Consequently, <code>str</code> needs to be converted every time it is used as a number (instead of just the first time), unless it was originally assigned a pure number.</p>
<p>The built-in "variables" <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>A_PtrSize</code>, <code>A_IsUnicode</code>, <code>A_Index</code> and <code>A_EventInfo</code> always return pure integers, not strings. They sometimes return strings in v1 due to certain optimizations which have been superseded in v2.</p>
<p>All literal numbers are converted to pure binary numbers at load time and their string representation is discarded. For example, <code>MsgBox 0x1</code> is equivalent to <code>MsgBox 1</code>, while <code>MsgBox 1.0000</code> is equivalent to <code>MsgBox 1.0</code> (because the float formatting has changed). Storing a number in a variable or returning it from a user-defined function retains its pure numeric status.</p>
<p>The default format specifier for floating-point numbers is now <code>.17g</code> (was <code>0.6f</code>), which is more compact and more accurate in many cases. The default cannot be changed, but <code>Format</code> can be used to get different formatting.</p>
<p>Quoted literal strings and strings produced by concatenating with quoted literal strings are no longer unconditionally considered non-numeric. Instead, they are treated the same as strings stored in variables or returned from functions. This has the following implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quoted literal <code>"0"</code> is considered false.</li>
<li><code>("0xA") + 1</code> and <code>("0x" Chr(65)) + 1</code> produce 11 instead of failing.</li>
<li><code>x[y:="0"]</code> and <code>x["0"]</code> now behave the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>The operators <code>=</code> and <code>!=</code> now compare their operands alphabetically if both are strings, even if they are numeric strings. Numeric comparison is still performed when both operands are numeric and at least one operand is a pure number (not a string). So for example, 54 and "530" are compared numerically, while "54" and "530" are compared alphabetically. Additionally, strings stored in variables are treated no differently from literal strings.</p>
<p>The relational operators <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;=</code> now throw an exception if used with a non-numeric string. Previously they compared numerically or alphabetically depending on whether both inputs were numeric, but literal quoted strings were always considered non-numeric. Use <code>StrCompare(a, b, CaseSense)</code> instead.</p>
<p><code>Type(Value)</code> returns one of the following strings: String, Integer, Float, or the specific class of an object.</p>
<p><code>Float(v)</code>, <code>Integer(v)</code> and <code>String(v)</code> convert <code>v</code> to the respective type, or throw an exception if the conversion cannot be performed (e.g. <code>Integer("1z")</code>). <code>Number(v)</code> converts to Integer or Float. <code>String</code> calls <code>v.ToString()</code> if <code>v</code> is an object. (Ideally this would be done for any implicit conversion from object to string, but the current implementation makes this difficult.)</p>
<h2 id="objects">Objects</h2>
<p>Objects now use a more structured class-prototype approach, separating class/static members from instance members. Many of the built-in methods and Obj functions have been moved, renamed, changed or removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each user-defined or built-in class is a class object (an instance of <a href="lib/Class.htm">Class</a>) exposing only methods and properties defined with the <code>static</code> keyword (including static members inherited from the base class) and nested classes.</li>
<li>Each class object has a <a href="lib/Class.htm#Prototype">Prototype</a> property which becomes the <code>base</code> of all instances of that class. All non-static method and property definitions inside the class body are attached to the prototype object.</li>
<li>Instantiation is performed by calling the static <a href="lib/Class.htm#Call">Call</a> method, as in <code>myClass.Call()</code> or <code>myClass()</code>. This allows the class to fully override construction behaviour (e.g. to implement a class factory or singleton, or to construct a native Array or Map instead of an Object), although initialization should still typically be performed in <code>__New</code>. The return value of <code>__New</code> is now ignored; to override the return value, do so from the Call method.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mixed Object type has been split into <code>Object</code>, <code>Array</code> and <code>Map</code> (associative array).</p>
<p>Object is now the root class for all user-defined <strong>and built-in</strong> objects (this excludes VarRef and COM objects). Members added to <code>Object.Prototype</code> are inherited by all AutoHotkey objects.</p>
<p>The operator <code>is</code> expects a class, so <code>x is y</code> checks for <code>y.Prototype</code> in the base object chain. To check for <code>y</code> itself, call <code>x.HasBase(y)</code> or <code>HasBase(x, y)</code>.</p>
<p>User-defined classes can also explicitly extend <code>Object</code>, <code>Array</code>, <code>Map</code> or some other built-in class (though doing so is not always useful), with <code>Object</code> being the default base class if none is specified.</p>
<p>The <code>new</code> operator has been removed. Instead, just omit the operator, as in <code>MyClass()</code>. To construct an object <em>based on</em> another object that is not a class, create it with <code>{}</code> or <code>Object()</code> (or by any other means) and set its <code>base</code>. <code>__Init</code> and <code>__New</code> can be called explicitly if needed, but generally this is only appropriate when instantiating a class.</p>
<p>Nested class definitions now produce a dynamic property with <em>get</em> and <em>call</em> accessor functions instead of a simple value property. This is to support the following behaviour:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Nested.Class()</code> does not pass <code>Nested</code> to <code>Nested.Class.Call</code> and ultimately <code>__New</code>, which would otherwise happen because this is the normal behaviour for function objects called as methods (which is how the nested class is being used here).</li>
<li><code>Nested.Class := 1</code> is an error by default (the property is read-only).</li>
<li>Referring to or calling the class for the first time causes it to be initialized.</li>
</ul>
<p>GetCapacity and SetCapacity were removed.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="lib/Object.htm#GetCapacity">ObjGetCapacity</a> and <a href="lib/Object.htm#SetCapacity">ObjSetCapacity</a> now only affect the object's capacity to contain properties, and are not expected to be commonly used. Setting the capacity of the string buffer of a property, array element or map element is not supported; for binary data, use a <a href="lib/Buffer.htm">Buffer</a> object.</li>
<li>Array and Map have a Capacity property which corresponds to the object's current array or map allocation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other redundant Obj functions (which mirror built-in methods of Object) were removed. <a href="lib/Object.htm#HasOwnProp">ObjHasOwnProp</a> (formerly ObjHasKey) and <a href="lib/Object.htm#OwnProps">ObjOwnProps</a> (formerly ObjNewEnum) are kept to facilitate safe inspection of objects which have redefined those methods (and the primitive prototypes, which don't have them defined). ObjCount was replaced with <a href="lib/Object.htm#OwnPropCount">ObjOwnPropCount</a> (a function only, for all Objects) and Map has its own <a href="lib/Map.htm#Count">Count</a> property.</p>
<p>ObjRawGet and ObjRawSet were merged into <a href="lib/Object.htm#GetOwnPropDesc">GetOwnPropDesc</a> and <a href="lib/Object.htm#DefineProp">DefineProp</a>. The original reasons for adding them were superseded by other changes, such as the <code>Map</code> type, changes to how meta-functions work, and DefineProp itself superseding meta-functions for some purposes.</p>
<p>Top-level class definitions now create a constant (read-only variable); that is, assigning to a class name is now an error rather than an optional warning, except where a local variable shadows the global class (which now occurs by default when assigning inside a function).</p>
<h3 id="primitive-values">Primitive Values</h3>
<p>Primitive values emulate objects by delegating method and property calls to a prototype object based on their type, instead of the v1 "default base object". Integer and Float extend Number. String and Number extend Primitive. Primitive and Object extend Any. These all exist as predefined classes.</p>
<h3 id="properties-and-methods">Properties and Methods</h3>
<p>Methods are defined by properties, unlike v2.0-a104 to v2.0-a127, where they are separate to properties. However, unlike v1, properties created by a class method definition (or built-in method) are read-only by default. Methods can still be created by assigning new value properties, which generally act as in v1.</p>
<p>The Object class defines new methods for dealing with properties and methods: <a href="lib/Object.htm#DefineProp">DefineProp</a>, <a href="lib/Object.htm#DeleteProp">DeleteProp</a>, <a href="lib/Object.htm#GetOwnPropDesc">GetOwnPropDesc</a>, <a href="lib/Object.htm#HasOwnProp">HasOwnProp</a>, <a href="lib/Object.htm#OwnProps">OwnProps</a>. Additional methods are defined for all values (except ComObjects): <a href="lib/Any.htm#GetMethod">GetMethod</a>, <a href="lib/Any.htm#HasProp">HasProp</a>, <a href="lib/Any.htm#HasMethod">HasMethod</a>.</p>
<p>Object, Array and Map are now separate types, and array elements are separate from properties.</p>
<p>All built-in methods and properties (including <code>base</code>) are defined the same way as if user-defined. This ensures consistent behaviour and permits both built-in and user-defined members to be detected, retrieved or redefined.</p>
<p>If a property does not accept parameters, they are automatically passed to the object returned by the property (or it throws).</p>
<p>Attempting to retrieve a non-existent property is treated as an error for all types of values or objects, unless <code>__get</code> is defined. However, setting a non-existent property will create it in most cases.</p>
<p>Multi-dimension array hacks were removed.  <code>x.y[z]:=1</code> no longer creates an object in <code>x.y</code>, and <code>x[y,z]</code> is an error unless x.__item handles two parameters (or x.__item.__item does, etc.).</p>
<p>If a property defines <code>get</code> but not <code>set</code>, assigning a value throws instead of overriding the property.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Object.htm#DefineProp">DefineProp</a> can be used to define what happens when a specific property is retrieved, set <em>or called</em>, without having to define any meta-functions. Property and method definitions in classes utilize the same mechanism, so it is possible to define a property getter/setter and a method with the same name.</p>
<p><code>{}</code> object literals now directly set <em>own property</em> values or the object's <code>base</code>. That is, <code>__Set</code> and property setters are no longer invoked (which would typically only be possible if <code>base</code> is set within the parameter list).</p>
<h3 id="staticclass-variables">Static/Class Variables</h3>
<p>Static/class variable initializers are now executed within the context of a <code>static __Init</code> method, so <code>this</code> refers to the class and the initializers can create local variables. They are evaluated when the class is referenced for the first time (rather than being evaluated before the auto-execute section begins, strictly in the order of definition). If the class is not referenced sooner, they are evaluated when the class definition is reached during execution, so initialization of global variables can occur first, without putting them into a class.</p>
<h3 id="meta-functions">Meta-Functions</h3>
<p>Meta-functions were greatly simplified; they act like normal methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where they are defined within the hierarchy is not important.</li>
<li>If overridden, the base version is not called  automatically.  Scripts can call <code>super.__xxx()</code> if needed.</li>
<li>If defined, it must perform the default action; e.g. if __set does not store the value, it is not stored.</li>
<li>Behaviour is not dependent on whether the method uses <code>return</code> (but of course, __get and __call still need to return a value).</li>
</ul>
<p>Method and property parameters are passed as an Array. This optimizes for chained base/superclass calls and (in combination with MaxParams validation) encourages authors to handle the args. For __set, the value being assigned is passed separately.</p>
<pre><code><div>this.__call(name, args)
this.__get(name, args)
this.__set(name, args, value)
</div></code></pre>
<p>Defined properties and methods take precedence over meta-functions, regardless of whether they were defined in a base object.</p>
<p>__Call is not called for internal calls to __Enum (formerly _NewEnum) or Call, such as when an object is passed to a for-loop or a function object is being called by SetTimer.</p>
<p>The static method __New is called for each class when it is initialized, if defined by that class or inherited from a superclass. See <a href="#staticclass-variables">Static/Class Variables</a> (above) and <a href="Objects.htm#static__New">Class Initialization</a> for more detail.</p>
<h3 id="array">Array</h3>
<p><code>class Array extends Object</code></p>
<p>An Array object contains a list or sequence of values, with index 1 being the first element.</p>
<p>When assigning or retrieving an array element, the absolute value of the index must be between 1 and the <a href="lib/Array.htm#Length">Length</a> of the array, otherwise an exception is thrown. An array can be resized by inserting or removing elements with the appropriate method, or by assigning <a href="lib/Array.htm#Length">Length</a>.</p>
<p>Currently brackets are required when accessing elements; i.e. <code>a.1</code> refers to a property and <code>a[1]</code> refers to an element.</p>
<p>Negative values can be used to index in reverse.</p>
<p>Usage of <a href="lib/Array.htm#Clone">Clone</a>, <a href="lib/Array.htm#Delete">Delete</a>, <a href="lib/Array.htm#InsertAt">InsertAt</a>, <a href="lib/Array.htm#Pop">Pop</a>, <a href="lib/Array.htm#Push">Push</a> and <a href="lib/Array.htm#RemoveAt">RemoveAt</a> is basically unchanged. HasKey was renamed to <a href="lib/Array.htm#Has">Has</a>. <a href="lib/Array.htm#Length">Length</a> is now a property. The <a href="lib/Array.htm#Capacity">Capacity</a> property was added.</p>
<p>Arrays can be constructed with <code>Array(values*)</code> or <code>[values*]</code>. Variadic functions receive an Array of parameters, and Arrays are also created by several built-in functions.</p>
<p>For-loop usage is <code>for val in arr</code> or <code>for idx, val in arr</code>, where <code>idx = A_Index</code> by default. That is, elements lacking a value are still enumerated, and the index is not returned if only one variable is passed.</p>
<h3 id="map">Map</h3>
<p>A Map object is an associative array with capabilities similar to the v1 Object, but less ambiguity.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="lib/Map.htm#Clone">Clone</a> is used as before.</li>
<li><a href="lib/Map.htm#Delete">Delete</a> can only delete one key at a time.</li>
<li>HasKey was renamed to <a href="lib/Map.htm#Has">Has</a>.</li>
<li><a href="lib/Map.htm#Count">Count</a> is now a property.</li>
<li>New properties: <a href="lib/Map.htm#Capacity">Capacity</a>, <a href="lib/Map.htm#CaseSense">CaseSense</a></li>
<li>New methods: <a href="lib/Map.htm#Get">Get</a>, <a href="lib/Map.htm#Set">Set</a>, <a href="lib/Map.htm#Clear">Clear</a></li>
<li>String keys are case-sensitive by default and are never converted to Integer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently Float keys are still converted to strings.</p>
<p>Brackets are required when accessing elements; i.e. <code>a.b</code> refers to a property and <code>a["b"]</code> refers to an element. Unlike in v1, a property or method cannot be accidentally disabled by assigning an array element.</p>
<p>An exception is thrown if one attempts to retrieve the value of an element which does not exist, unless the map has a <a href="lib/Map.htm#Default">Default</a> property defined. <code>MapObj.Get(key, default)</code> can be used to explicitly provide a default value for each request.</p>
<p>Use <code>Map(Key, Value, ...)</code> to create a map from a list of key-value pairs.</p>
<h3 id="enumeration">Enumeration</h3>
<p>Changed enumerator model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced _NewEnum() with __Enum(n).</li>
<li>The required parameter n contains the number of variables in the for-loop, to allow it to affect enumeration without having to postpone initialization until the first iteration call.</li>
<li>Replaced Next() with Call(), with the same usage except that ByRef works differently now; for instance, a method defined as <code>Call(&amp;a)</code> should assign <code>a := next_value</code> while <code>Call(a)</code> would receive a <code>VarRef</code>, so should assign <code>%a% := next_value</code>.</li>
<li>If __Enum is not present, the object is assumed to be an enumerator. This allows function objects (such as closures) to be used directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since array elements and properties are now separate, enumerating properties requires explicitly creating an enumerator by calling <a href="lib/Object.htm#OwnProps">OwnProps</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bound-functions">Bound Functions</h3>
<p>When a bound function is called, parameters passed by the caller fill in any positions that were omitted when creating the bound function. For example, <code>F.Bind(,b).Call(a,c)</code> calls <code>F(a,b,c)</code> rather than <code>F(,b,a,c)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="com-objects-comobject">COM Objects (ComObject)</h3>
<p>COM wrapper objects now identify as instances of a few different classes depending on their variant type (which affects what methods and properties they support, as before):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ComValue</code> is the base class for all COM wrapper objects.</li>
<li><code>ComObject</code> is for VT_DISPATCH with a non-null pointer; that is, typically a valid COM object that can be invoked by the script using normal object syntax.</li>
<li><code>ComObjArray</code> is for VT_ARRAY (SafeArrays).</li>
<li><code>ComValueRef</code> is for VT_BYREF.</li>
</ul>
<p>These classes can be used for type checks with <code>obj is ComObject</code> and similar. Properties and methods can be defined for objects of type ComValue, ComObjArray and ComValueRef (but not ComObject) by modifying the respective prototype object.</p>
<p><code>ComObject(CLSID)</code> creates a ComObject; i.e. this is the new ComObjCreate.</p>
<p>Note: If you are updating old code and get a TypeError due to passing an Integer to ComObject, it's likely that you should be calling ComValue instead.</p>
<p><code>ComValue(vt, value)</code> creates a wrapper object. It can return an instance of any of the classes listed above. This replaces <code>ComObjParameter(vt, value)</code>, <code>ComObject(vt, value)</code> and any other names that were used with a <em>variant type</em> and <em>value</em> as parameters. <em>value</em> is converted to the appropriate type (following COM conventions), instead of requiring an integer with the right binary value. In particular, the following behave differently to before when passed an integer: R4, R8, Cy, Date. Pointer types permit either a pure integer address as before, or an object/ComValue.</p>
<p><code>ComObjFromPtr(pdsp)</code> is a function similar to <code>ComObjEnwrap(dsp)</code>, but like ObjFromPtr, it does not call AddRef on the pointer. The equivalent in v1 is <code>ComObject(9, dsp, 1)</code>; omitting the third parameter in v1 caused an AddRef.</p>
<p>For both ComValue and ComObjFromPtr, be warned that AddRef is never called automatically; in that respect, they behave like <code>ComObject(9, value, 1)</code> or <code>ComObject(13, value, 1)</code> in v1. This does not necessarily mean you should add <code>ObjAddRef(value)</code> when updating old scripts, as many scripts used the old function incorrectly.</p>
<p>COM wrapper objects with variant type VT_BYREF, VT_ARRAY or VT_UNKNOWN now have a <code>Ptr</code> property equivalent to <code>ComObjValue(ComObj)</code>. This allows them to be passed to DllCall or ComCall with the <code>Ptr</code> arg type. It also allows the object to be passed directly to NumPut or NumGet, which may be used with VT_BYREF (access the caller's typed variable), VT_ARRAY (access SAFEARRAY fields) or VT_UNKNOWN (retrieve vtable pointer).</p>
<p>COM wrapper objects with variant type VT_DISPATCH or VT_UNKNOWN and a null interface pointer now have a <code>Ptr</code> property which can be read or assigned. Once assigned a non-null pointer, the property is read-only. This is intended for use with DllCall and ComCall, so the pointer does not need to be manually wrapped after the function returns.</p>
<p>Enumeration of ComObjArray is now consistent with Array; i.e. <code>for value in arr</code> or <code>for index, value in arr</code> rather than <code>for value, vartype in arr</code>. The starting value for <code>index</code> is the lower bound of the ComObjArray (<code>arr.MinIndex()</code>), typically 0.</p>
<p>The integer types I1, I8, UI1, UI2, UI4 and UI8 are now converted to Integer rather than String. These occur rarely in COM calls, but this also applies to VT_BYREF wrappers. VT_ERROR is no longer converted to Integer; it instead produces a ComValue.</p>
<p>COM objects no longer set <a href="Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> when a property or method invocation fails.</p>
<h3 id="default-property">Default Property</h3>
<p>A COM object may have a "default property", which has two uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>value</em> of the object. For instance, in VBScript, <code>MsgBox obj</code> evaluates the object by invoking its default member.</li>
<li>The indexed property of a collection, which is usually named <code>Item</code> or <code>item</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>AutoHotkey v1 had no concept of a default property, so the COM object wrapper would invoke the default property if the property name was omitted; i.e. <code>obj[]</code> or <code>obj[,x]</code>.</p>
<p>However, AutoHotkey v2 separates properties from array/map/collection items, and to do this <code>obj[x]</code> is mapped to the object's default property (whether or not <code>x</code> is present). For AutoHotkey objects, this is <code>__Item</code>.</p>
<p>Some COM objects which represent arrays or collections do not expose a default property, so items cannot be accessed with <code>[]</code> in v2. For instance, JavaScript array objects and some other objects normally used with JavaScript expose array elements as properties. In such cases, <code>arr.%i%</code> can be used to access an array element-property.</p>
<p>When an AutoHotkey v2 <code>Array</code> object is passed to JavaScript, its elements cannot be retrieved with JavaScript's <code>arr[i]</code>, because that would attempt to access a property.</p>
<h3 id="com-calls">COM Calls</h3>
<p>Calls to AutoHotkey objects via the IDispatch interface now transparently support <code>VT_BYREF</code> parameters. This would most commonly be used with COM events (<a href="lib/ComObjConnect.htm">ComObjConnect</a>).</p>
<p>For each <code>VT_BYREF</code> parameter, an unnamed temporary var is created, the value is copied from the caller's variable, and a <code>VarRef</code> is passed to the AutoHotkey function/method. Upon return, the value is copied from the temporary var back into the caller's variable.</p>
<p>A function/method can assign a value by declaring the parameter ByRef (with <code>&amp;</code>) or by explicit dereferencing.</p>
<p>For example, a parameter of type <code>VT_BYREF|VT_BOOL</code> would previously have received a ComObjRef object, and would be assigned a value like <code>pbCancel[] := true</code> or <code>NumPut(-1, ComObjValue(pbCancel), "short")</code>. Now the parameter can be defined as <code>&amp;bCancel</code> and assigned like <code>bCancel := true</code>; or can be defined as <code>pbCancel</code> and assigned like <code>%pbCancel% := true</code>.</p>

<p class="note">About the section title: there are no commands in v2, just functions. The title refers to both versions.</p>
<p><a href="lib/BlockInput.htm">BlockInput</a> is no longer momentarily disabled whenever an Alt event is sent with the SendEvent method. This was originally done to work around a bug in some versions of Windows XP, where BlockInput blocked the artificial Alt event.</p>
<p><code>Chr(0)</code> returns a string of length 1, containing a binary zero. This is a result of improved support for binary zero in strings.</p>
<p><a href="lib/ClipWait.htm">ClipWait</a> now returns 0 if the wait period expires, otherwise 1. ErrorLevel was removed. Specifying 0 is no longer the same as specifying 0.5; instead, it produces the shortest wait possible.</p>
<p><code>ComObj()</code>: This function had a sort of wildcard name, allowing many different suffixes. Some names were more commonly used with specific types of parameters, such as <code>ComObjActive(CLSID)</code>, <code>ComObjParameter(vt, value)</code>, <code>ComObjEnwrap(dsp)</code>. There are instead now separate functions/classes, and no more wildcard names. See <a href="#com-objects-comobject">COM Objects (ComObject)</a> for details.</p>
<p>Control: Several changes have been made to <a href="lib/Control.htm#Parameter">the <em>Control</em> parameter</a> used by the <a href="lib/Control.htm">Control functions</a>, <a href="lib/SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> and <a href="lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can now accept a HWND (must be a pure integer) or an object with a <code>Hwnd</code> property, such as a <a href="lib/GuiControl.htm">GuiControl</a> object. The HWND can identify a control or a top-level window, though the latter is usually only meaningful for a select few functions (see below).</li>
<li>It is no longer optional, except with functions which can operate on a top-level window (<a href="lib/ControlSend.htm">ControlSend[Text]</a>, <a href="lib/ControlClick.htm">ControlClick</a>, <a href="lib/SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>, <a href="lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a>) or when preceded by other optional parameters (<a href="lib/ListViewGetContent.htm">ListViewGetContent</a>, <a href="lib/ControlGetPos.htm">ControlGetPos</a>, <a href="lib/ControlMove.htm">ControlMove</a>).</li>
<li>If omitted, the target window is used instead. This matches the previous behaviour of <a href="lib/SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>/<a href="lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a>, and replaces the <code>ahk_parent</code> special value previously used by <a href="lib/ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a>.</li>
<li>Blank values are invalid. Functions never default to the target window's topmost control.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="lib/ControlGetFocus.htm">ControlGetFocus</a> now returns the control's HWND instead of its ClassNN, and no longer considers there to be an error when it has successfully determined that the window has no focused control.</p>
<p><a href="lib/ControlMove.htm">ControlMove</a>, <a href="lib/ControlGetPos.htm">ControlGetPos</a> and <a href="lib/ControlClick.htm">ControlClick</a> now use client coordinates (like <a href="lib/GuiControl.htm">GuiControl</a>) instead of window coordinates. Client coordinates are relative to the top-left of the client area, which excludes the window's title bar and borders. (Controls are rendered only inside the client area.)</p>
<p><a href="lib/ControlMove.htm">ControlMove</a>, <a href="lib/ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a> and <a href="lib/ControlSetText.htm">ControlSetText</a> now use parameter order consistent with the other Control functions; i.e. <em><strong>Control</strong>, WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</em> are always grouped together (at the end of the parameter list), to aide memorisation.</p>
<p><a href="lib/CoordMode.htm">CoordMode</a> no longer accepts "Relative" as a mode, since all modes are relative to something. It was synonymous with "Window", so use that instead.</p>
<p><a href="lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>: See <a href="#dllcall">DllCall</a> section further below.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Edit.htm">Edit</a> previously had fallback behaviour for the <code>.ini</code> file type if the "edit" shell verb was not registered. This was removed as script files are not expected to have the <code>.ini</code> extension. <code>AutoHotkey.ini</code> was the default script name in old versions of AutoHotkey.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Edit.htm">Edit</a> now does nothing if the script was read from stdin, instead of attempting to open an editor for <code>*</code>.</p>
<p><a href="lib/EnvSet.htm">EnvSet</a> now deletes the environment variable if the value parameter is completely omitted.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Exit.htm">Exit</a> previously acted as <a href="lib/ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> when the script is not persistent, even if there were other suspended threads interrupted by the thread which called Exit. It no longer does this. Instead, it always exits the current thread properly, and (if non-persistent) the script terminates only after the last thread exits. This ensures <code>finally</code> statements are executed and local variables are freed, which may allow <code>__delete</code> to be called for any objects contained by local variables.</p>
<p><a href="lib/FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> defaults to no end-of-line translations, consistent with <a href="lib/FileRead.htm">FileRead</a> and <a href="lib/FileOpen.htm">FileOpen</a>. FileAppend and FileRead both have a separate <em>Options</em> parameter which replaces the option prefixes and may include an optional encoding name (superseding FileRead's <code>*Pnnn</code> option). FileAppend, FileRead and FileOpen use <code>"`n"</code> to enable end-of-line translations. FileAppend and FileRead support an option <code>"RAW"</code> to disable codepage conversion (read/write binary data); FileRead returns a <code>Buffer</code> object in this case. This replaces <code>*c</code> (see ClipboardAll in the documentation). FileAppend may accept a <code>Buffer</code>-like object, in which case no conversions are performed.</p>
<p><a href="lib/FileCopy.htm">FileCopy</a> and <a href="lib/FileMove.htm">FileMove</a> now throw an exception if the source path does not contain <code>*</code> or <code>?</code> and no file was not found. However, it is still not considered an error to copy or move zero files when the source path contains wildcards.</p>
<p><a href="lib/FileOpen.htm">FileOpen</a> now throws an exception if it fails to open the file. Otherwise, an exception would be thrown (if the script didn't check for failure) by the first attempt to access the object, rather than at the actual point of failure.</p>
<p><a href="lib/File.htm#RawRead">File.RawRead</a>: When a variable is passed directly, the address of the variable's internal string buffer is no longer used. Therefore, a variable containing an address may be passed directly (whereas in v1, something like <code>var+0</code> was necessary).</p>
<p>For buffers allocated by the script, the new <code>Buffer</code> object is preferred over a variable; any object can be used, but must have <code>Ptr</code> and <code>Size</code> properties.</p>
<p><a href="lib/File.htm#RawWrite">File.RawWrite</a>: As above, except that it can accept a string (or variable containing a string), in which case <em>Bytes</em> defaults to the size of the string in bytes. The string may contain binary zero.</p>
<p><a href="lib/File.htm#ReadLine">File.ReadLine</a> now always supports <code>`r</code>, <code>`n</code> and <code>`r`n</code> as line endings, and no longer includes the line ending in the return value. Line endings are still returned to the script as-is by <a href="lib/File.htm#Read">File.Read</a> if EOL translation is not enabled.</p>
<p><a href="lib/FileEncoding.htm">FileEncoding</a> now allows code pages to be specified by number without the <code>CP</code> prefix. Its parameter is no longer optional, but can still be explicitly blank.</p>
<p><a href="lib/FileExist.htm">FileExist</a> now ignores the <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> implied in every directory listing, so <code>FileExist("dir\*")</code> is now false instead of true when dir exists but is empty.</p>
<p><a href="lib/FileGetAttrib.htm">FileGetAttrib</a> and A_LoopFileAttrib now include the letter "L" for reparse points or symbolic links.</p>
<p><a href="lib/FileInstall.htm">FileInstall</a> in a non-compiled script no longer attempts to copy the file if source and destination are the same path (after resolving relative paths, as the source is relative to <a href="Variables.htm#ScriptDir">A_ScriptDir</a>, not <a href="Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a>). In v1 this caused ErrorLevel to be set to 1, which mostly went unnoticed. Attempting to copy a file onto itself via two different paths still causes an error.</p>
<p>FileSelectFile (now named <a href="lib/FileSelect.htm">FileSelect</a>) had two multi-select modes, accessible via options 4 and M. Option 4 and the corresponding mode have been removed; they had been undocumented for some time. FileSelect now returns an Array of paths when the multi-select mode is used, instead of a string like <code>C:\Dir`nFile1`nFile2</code>. Each array element contains the full path of a file. If the user cancels, the array is empty.</p>
<p>FileSelect now uses the IFileDialog API present in Windows Vista and later, instead of the old GetOpenFileName/GetSaveFileName API. This removes the need for (built-in) workarounds relating to the dialog changing the current working directory.</p>
<p>FileSelect no longer has a redundant "Text Documents (*.txt)" filter by default when <em>Filter</em> is omitted.</p>
<p>FileSelect no longer strips spaces from the filter pattern, such as for <code>pattern with spaces*.ext</code>. Testing indicates spaces on either side of the pattern (such as after the semi-colon in <code>*.cpp; *.h</code>) are already ignored by the OS, so there should be no negative consequences.</p>
<p>FileSelect can now be used in "Select Folder" mode via the <code>D</code> option letter.</p>
<p><a href="lib/FileSetAttrib.htm">FileSetAttrib</a> now overwrites attributes when no +, - or ^ prefix is present, instead of doing nothing. For example, <code>FileSetAttrib(FileGetAttrib(file2), file1)</code> copies the attributes of file2 to file1 (adding any that file2 have and removing any that it does not have).</p>
<p><a href="lib/FileSetAttrib.htm">FileSetAttrib</a> and <a href="lib/FileSetTime.htm">FileSetTime</a>: the <em>OperateOnFolders?</em> and <em>Recurse?</em> parameters have been replaced with a single <em>Mode</em> parameter identical to that of <a href="lib/LoopFiles.htm">Loop Files</a>. For example, <code>FileSetAttrib("+a", "*.zip", "RF")</code> (Recursively operate on Files only).</p>
<p><a href="lib/GetKeyName.htm">GetKeyName</a> now returns the non-Numpad names for VK codes that correspond to both a Numpad and a non-Numpad key. For instance, <code>GetKeyName("vk25")</code> returns Left instead of NumpadLeft.</p>
<p><a href="lib/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a> now always returns 0 or 1.</p>
<p><a href="lib/GroupActivate.htm">GroupActivate</a> now returns the HWND of the window which was selected for activation, or 0 if there were no matches (aside from the already-active window), instead of setting ErrorLevel.</p>
<p><a href="lib/GroupAdd.htm">GroupAdd</a>: Removed the <em>Label</em> parameter and related functionality. This was an unintuitive way to detect when GroupActivate fails to find any matching windows; GroupActivate's return value should be used instead.</p>
<p><a href="lib/GroupDeactivate.htm">GroupDeactivate</a> now selects windows in a manner closer to the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> system hotkeys and the taskbar. Specifically,</p>
<ul>
<li>Owned windows are not evaluated. If the owner window is eligible (not a match for the group), either the owner window or one of its owned windows is activated; whichever was active last. A window owned by a group member will no longer be activated, but adding the owned window itself to the group now has no effect. (The previous behaviour was to cycle through every owned window and never activate the owner.)</li>
<li>Any disabled window is skipped, unless one of its owned windows was active more recently than it.</li>
<li>Windows with the WS_EX_NOACTIVATE style are skipped, since they are probably not supposed to be activated. They are also skipped by the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> system hotkeys.</li>
<li>Windows with WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW but not WS_EX_APPWINDOW are omitted from the taskbar and Alt-Tab, and are therefore skipped.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> no longer defaults to the script's bottommost <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> (formerly #If).  Hotkey/hotstring and HotIf threads default to the same criterion as the hotkey, so <code>Hotkey A_ThisHotkey, "Off"</code> turns off the current hotkey even if it is context-sensitive. All other threads default to the last setting used by the auto-execute section, which itself defaults to no criterion (global hotkeys).</p>
<p><a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a>'s <em>Callback</em> parameter now requires a function object or hotkey name. Labels and function names are no longer supported. If a hotkey name is specified, the original function of that hotkey is used; and unlike before, this works with <a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> (formerly #If).</p>
<ul>
<li>Among other benefits, this eliminates ambiguity with the following special strings: <code>On</code>, <code>Off</code>, <code>Toggle</code>, <code>AltTab</code>, <code>ShiftAltTab</code>, <code>AltTabAndMenu</code>, <code>AltTabMenuDismiss</code>.  The old behaviour was to use the label/function by that name if one existed, but only if the <em>Label</em> parameter did not contain a variable reference or expression.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> and <a href="lib/Hotstring.htm">Hotstring</a> now support the S option to make the hotkey/hostring exempt from <a href="lib/Suspend.htm">Suspend</a> (equivalent to the new <a href="lib/_SuspendExempt.htm">#SuspendExempt</a> directive), and the S0 option to disable exemption.</p>
<p>"Hotkey If" and the other If sub-commands were replaced with individual functions: <a href="lib/HotIf.htm">HotIf, HotIfWinActive, HotIfWinExist, HotIfWinNotActive, HotIfWinNotExist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="lib/HotIf.htm">HotIf</a> (formerly "Hotkey If") now recognizes expressions which use the <code>and</code> or <code>or</code> operators. This did not work in v1 as these operators were replaced with <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> at load time.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> no longer has a <code>UseErrorLevel</code> option, and never sets ErrorLevel.  An exception is thrown on failure.  Error messages were changed to be constant (and shorter), with the key or hotkey name in <code>Exception.Extra</code>, and the class of the exception indicating the reason for failure.</p>
<p><a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> (formerly #If) now implicitly creates a function with one parameter (ThisHotkey). As is the default for all functions, this function is assume-local. The expression can create local variables and read global variables, but cannot directly assign to global variables as the expression cannot contain declarations.</p>
<p><a href="lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> has been optimized so that simple calls to <a href="lib/WinActive.htm">WinActive</a> or <a href="lib/WinExist.htm">WinExist</a> can be evaluated directly by the hook thread (as #IfWin was in v1, and <a href="lib/HotIf.htm">HotIfWin</a> still is). This improves performance and reduces the risk of problems when the script is busy/unresponsive. This optimization applies to expressions which contain a single call to <a href="lib/WinActive.htm">WinActive</a> or <a href="lib/WinExist.htm">WinExist</a> with up to two parameters, where each parameter is a simple quoted string and the result is optionally inverted with <code>!</code> or <code>not</code>. For example, <code>#HotIf WinActive("Chrome")</code> or <code>#HotIf !WinExist("Popup")</code>. In these cases, the first expression with any given combination of criteria can be identified by either the expression or the window criteria. For example, <code>HotIf '!WinExist("Popup")'</code> and <code>HotIfWinNotExist "Popup"</code> refer to the same hotkey variants.</p>
<p><code>KeyHistory N</code> resizes the key history buffer instead of displaying the key history. This replaces "#KeyHistory N".</p>
<p><a href="lib/ImageSearch.htm">ImageSearch</a> returns true if the image was found, false if it was not found, or throws an exception if the search could not be conducted. ErrorLevel is not set.</p>
<p><a href="lib/IniDelete.htm">IniDelete</a>, <a href="lib/IniRead.htm">IniRead</a> and <a href="lib/IniWrite.htm">IniWrite</a> set <a href="Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> to the result of the operating system's GetLastError() function.</p>
<p><a href="lib/IniRead.htm">IniRead</a> throws an exception if the requested key, section or file cannot be found and the <em>Default</em> parameter was omitted. If <em>Default</em> is given a value, even <code>""</code>, no exception is thrown.</p>
<p><a href="lib/InputHook.htm">InputHook</a> now treats <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> the same as <kbd>Backspace</kbd>, instead of transcribing it to <code>`b</code>.</p>
<p><a href="lib/InputBox.htm">InputBox</a> has been given a syntax overhaul to make it easier to use (with fewer parameters). See <a href="#inputbox">InputBox</a> for usage.</p>
<p><a href="lib/InStr.htm">InStr</a>'s <em>CaseSensitive</em> parameter has been replaced with <em>CaseSense</em>, which can be 0, 1 or "Locale".</p>
<p>InStr now searches right-to-left when <em>Occurrence</em> is negative (which previously caused a result of 0), and no longer searches right-to-left if a negative <em>StartingPos</em> is used with a positive <em>Occurrence</em>. (However, it still searches right-to-left if <em>StartingPos</em> is negative and <em>Occurrence</em> is omitted.) This facilitates right-to-left searches in a loop, and allows a negative <em>StartingPos</em> to be used while still searching left-to-right.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, <code>InStr(a, b,, -1, 2)</code> now searches left-to-right. To instead search right-to-left, use <code>InStr(a, b,, -1, -2)</code>.</li>
<li>Note that a <em>StartingPos</em> of -1 means the last character in v2, but the second last character in v1. If the example above came from v1 (rather than v2.0-a033 - v2.0-a136), the new code should be <code>InStr(a, b, -2, -2)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="lib/KeyWait.htm">KeyWait</a> now returns 0 if the wait period expires, otherwise 1. ErrorLevel was removed.</p>
<p><a href="lib/MouseClick.htm">MouseClick</a> and <a href="lib/MouseClickDrag.htm">MouseClickDrag</a> are no longer affected by the system setting for swapped mouse buttons; "Left" is the always the primary button and "Right" is the secondary.</p>
<p><a href="lib/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a> has had its syntax changed to prioritise its most commonly used parameters and improve ease of use. See <a href="#msgbox">MsgBox</a> further below for a summary of usage.</p>
<p><a href="lib/NumPut.htm">NumPut</a>/<a href="lib/NumGet.htm">NumGet</a>: When a variable is passed directly, the address of the variable's internal string buffer is no longer used. Therefore, a variable containing an address may be passed directly (whereas in v1, something like <code>var+0</code> was necessary). For buffers allocated by the script, the new <code>Buffer</code> object is preferred over a variable; any object can be used, but must have <code>Ptr</code> and <code>Size</code> properties.</p>
<p>NumPut's parameters were reordered to allow a sequence of values, with the (now mandatory) type string preceding each number. For example: <code>NumPut("ptr", a, "int", b, "int", c, addrOrBuffer, offset)</code>. Type is now mandatory for NumGet as well. (In comparison to DllCall, NumPut's input parameters correspond to the dll function's parameters, while NumGet's return type parameter corresponds to the dll function's return type string.)</p>
<p>The use of <code>Object(obj)</code> and <code>Object(ptr)</code> to convert between a reference and a pointer was shifted to separate functions, <code>ObjPtrAddRef(obj)</code> and <code>ObjFromPtrAddRef(ptr)</code>. There are also versions of these functions that do not increment the reference count: <code>ObjPtr(obj)</code> and <code>ObjFromPtr(ptr)</code>.</p>
<p>The OnClipboardChange label is no longer called automatically if it exists. Use the <a href="lib/OnClipboardChange.htm">OnClipboardChange</a> function which was added in v1.1.20 instead. It now requires a function object, not a name.</p>
<p><a href="lib/OnError.htm">OnError</a> now requires a function object, not a name. See also <a href="#error-handling">Error Handling</a> further below.</p>
<p>The OnExit command has been removed; use the <a href="lib/OnExit.htm">OnExit</a> function which was added in v1.1.20 instead. It now requires a function object, not a name.  A_ExitReason has also been removed; its value is available as a parameter of the OnExit callback function.</p>
<p><a href="lib/OnMessage.htm">OnMessage</a> no longer has the single-function-per-message mode that was used when a function name (string) was passed; it now only accepts a function by reference. Use <code>OnMessage(x, MyFunc)</code> where <em>MyFunc</em> is literally the name of a function, but note that the v1 equivalent would be <code>OnMessage(x, Func("MyFunc"))</code>, which allows other functions to continue monitoring message x, unlike <code>OnMessage(x, "MyFunc")</code>. To stop monitoring the message, use <code>OnMessage(x, MyFunc, 0)</code> as <code>OnMessage(x, "")</code> and <code>OnMessage(x)</code> are now errors. On failure, OnMessage throws an exception.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Pause.htm">Pause</a> is no longer exempt from <a href="lib/_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> when used on the first line of a hotkey, so <code>#p::Pause</code> is no longer suitable for toggling pause. Therefore, <code>Pause()</code> now only pauses the current thread (for combinations like ListVars/Pause), while <code>Pause(v)</code> now always operates on the underlying thread. <code>v</code> must be 0, 1 or -1. The second parameter was removed.</p>
<p><a href="lib/PixelSearch.htm">PixelSearch</a> and <a href="lib/PixelGetColor.htm">PixelGetColor</a> use RGB values instead of BGR, for consistency with other functions. Both functions throw an exception if a problem occurs, and no longer set ErrorLevel. PixelSearch returns true if the color was found. PixelSearch's slow mode was removed, as it is unusable on most modern systems due to an incompatibility with desktop composition.</p>
<p><a href="lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a>: See <a href="#SendMessage">SendMessage</a> further below.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Random.htm">Random</a> has been reworked to utilize the operating system's random number generator, lift several restrictions, and make it more convenient to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>The full 64-bit range of signed integer values is now supported (increased from 32-bit).</li>
<li>Floating-point numbers are generated from a 53-bit random integer, instead of a 32-bit random integer, and should be greater than or equal to Min and lesser than Max (but floating-point rounding errors can theoretically produce equal to Max).</li>
<li>The parameters could already be specified in any order, but now specifying only the first parameter defaults the other bound to 0 instead of 2147483647. For example, <code>Random(9)</code> returns a number between 0 and 9.</li>
<li>If both parameters are omitted, the return value is a floating-point number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (generally exclusive), instead of an integer between 0 and 2147483647 (inclusive).</li>
<li>The system automatically seeds the random number generator, and does not provide a way to manually seed it, so there is no replacement for the <em>NewSeed</em> parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="lib/RegExMatch.htm">RegExMatch</a> options O and P were removed; O (object) mode is now mandatory. The RegExMatch object now supports enumeration (for-loop). The match object's syntax has changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>__Get is used to implement the shorthand <code>match.subpat</code> where <em>subpat</em> is the name of a subpattern/capturing group. As __Get is no longer called if a property is <em>inherited</em>, the following subpattern names can no longer be used with the shorthand syntax: Pos, Len, Name, Count, Mark. (For example, <code>match.Len</code> always returns the length of the overall match, not a captured string.)</li>
<li>Originally the match object had methods instead of properties so that properties could be reserved for subpattern names. As new language behaviour implies that <code>match.name</code> would return a function by default, the methods have been replaced or supplemented with properties:
<ul>
<li>Pos, Len and Name are now properties and methods.</li>
<li>Name now requires 1 parameter to avoid confusion (<code>match.Name</code> throws an error).</li>
<li>Count and Mark are now only properties.</li>
<li>Value has been removed; use <code>match.0</code> or <code>match[]</code> instead of <code>match.Value()</code>, and <code>match[N]</code> instead of <code>match.Value(N)</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>RegisterCallback was renamed to <a href="lib/CallbackCreate.htm">CallbackCreate</a> and changed to better utilize closures:</p>
<ul>
<li>It now supports <a href="misc/Functor.htm">function objects</a> (and no longer supports function names).</li>
<li>Removed EventInfo parameter (use a closure or bound function instead).</li>
<li>Removed the special behaviour of variadic callback functions and added the <code>&amp;</code> option (pass the address of the parameter list).</li>
<li>Added <code>CallbackFree(Address)</code>, to free the callback memory and release the associated function object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registry functions (<a href="lib/RegRead.htm">RegRead</a>, <a href="lib/RegWrite.htm">RegWrite</a>, <a href="lib/RegDelete.htm">RegDelete</a>): the new syntax added in v1.1.21+ is now the only syntax. Root key and subkey are combined. Instead of <code>RootKey, Key</code>, write <code>RootKey\Key</code>. To connect to a remote registry, use <code>\\ComputerName\RootKey\Key</code> instead of <code>\\ComputerName:RootKey, Key</code>.</p>
<p>RegWrite's parameters were reordered to put <em>Value</em> first, like IniWrite (but this doesn't affect the single-parameter mode, where <em>Value</em> was the only parameter).</p>
<p>When <em>KeyName</em> is omitted and the current loop reg item is a subkey, RegDelete, RegRead and RegWrite now operate on values within that subkey; i.e. <em>KeyName</em> defaults to <code>A_LoopRegKey "\" A_LoopRegName</code> in that case (note that A_LoopRegKey was merged with A_LoopRegSubKey). Previously they behaved as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>RegRead read a value with the same name as the subkey, if one existed in the parent key.</li>
<li>RegWrite returned an error.</li>
<li>RegDelete deleted the subkey.</li>
</ul>
<p>RegDelete, RegRead and RegWrite now allow <em>ValueName</em> to be specified when <em>KeyName</em> is omitted:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the current loop reg item is a subkey, <em>ValueName</em> defaults to empty (the subkey's default value) and <em>ValueType</em> must be specified.</li>
<li>If the current loop reg item is a value, <em>ValueName</em> and <em>ValueType</em> default to that value's name and type, but one or both can be overridden.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, RegDelete with a blank or omitted <em>ValueName</em> now deletes the key's default value (not the key itself), for consistency with RegWrite, RegRead and A_LoopRegName. The phrase "AHK_DEFAULT" no longer has any special meaning. To delete a key, use <a href="lib/RegDeleteKey.htm">RegDeleteKey</a> (new).</p>
<p><a href="lib/RegRead.htm">RegRead</a> now has a <em>Default</em> parameter, like IniRead.</p>
<p>RegRead had an undocumented 5-parameter mode, where the value type was specified after the output variable. This has been removed.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Reload.htm">Reload</a> now does nothing if the script was read from stdin.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> and <a href="lib/Run.htm">RunWait</a> no longer recognize the <code>UseErrorLevel</code> option as ErrorLevel was removed. Use try/catch instead. <a href="Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> is set unconditionally, and can be inspected after an exception is caught/suppressed. RunWait returns the exit code.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Send.htm">Send</a> (and its variants) now interpret <code>{LButton}</code> and <code>{RButton}</code> in a way consistent with hotkeys and <a href="lib/Click.htm">Click</a>. That is, LButton is the primary button and RButton is the secondary button, even if the user has swapped the buttons via system settings.</p>
<p id="SendMessage"><a href="lib/SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> and <a href="lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a> now require wParam and lParam to be integers or objects with a Ptr property; an exception is thrown if they are given a non-numeric string or float. Previously a string was passed by address if the expression began with <code>"</code>, but other strings were coerced to integers. Passing the address of a variable (formerly <code>&amp;var</code>, now <code>StrPtr(var)</code>) no longer updates the variable's length (use <code>VarSetStrCapacity(&amp;var, -1)</code>).</p>
<p>SendMessage and PostMessage now throw an exception on failure (or timeout) and do not set ErrorLevel. SendMessage returns the message reply.</p>
<p><a href="lib/SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a> no longer supports label or function names, but as it now accepts an expression and functions can be referenced directly by name, usage looks very similar: <code>SetTimer MyFunc</code>. As with all other functions which accept an object, SetTimer now allows expressions which return an object (previously it required a variable reference).</p>
<p><a href="lib/Sort.htm">Sort</a> has received the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>VarName</em> parameter has been split into separate input/output parameters, for flexibility. Usage is now <code>Output := Sort(Input [, Options, Function])</code>.</li>
<li>When any two items compare equal, the original order of the items is now automatically used as a tie-breaker to ensure more stable results.</li>
<li>The <code>C</code> option now also accepts a suffix equivalent to the <em>CaseSense</em> parameter of other functions (in addition to <code>CL</code>): <code>CLocale CLogical COn C1 COff C0</code>. In particular, support for the "logical" comparison mode is new.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Sound"><a href="lib/Sound.htm">Sound functions</a>: SoundGet and SoundSet have been revised to better match the capabilities of the Vista+ sound APIs, dropping support for XP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed unsupported control types.</li>
<li>Removed legacy mixer component types.</li>
<li>Let components be referenced by name and/or index.</li>
<li>Let devices be referenced by name-prefix and/or index.</li>
<li>Split into separate Volume and Mute functions.</li>
<li>Added <a href="lib/SoundGetName.htm">SoundGetName</a> for retrieving device or component names.</li>
<li>Added <a href="lib/SoundGetInterface.htm">SoundGetInterface</a> for retrieving COM interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="lib/StrGet.htm">StrGet</a>: If <em>Length</em> is negative, its absolute value indicates the exact number of characters to convert, including any binary zeros that the string might contain -- in other words, the result is always a string of exactly that length. If <em>Length</em> is positive, the converted string ends at the first binary zero as in v1.</p>
<p><a href="lib/StrGet.htm">StrGet</a>/<a href="lib/StrPut.htm">StrPut</a>: The <em>Address</em> parameter can be an object with the <code>Ptr</code> and <code>Size</code> properties, such as the new <code>Buffer</code> object. The read/write is automatically limited by <code>Size</code> (which is in bytes). If <em>Length</em> is also specified, it must not exceed <em>Size</em> (multiplied by 2 for UTF-16).</p>
<p>StrPut's return value is now in bytes, so it can be passed directly to Buffer().</p>
<p><a href="lib/StrReplace.htm">StrReplace</a> now has a <em>CaseSense</em> parameter in place of <em>OutputVarCount</em>, which is moved one parameter to the right, with <em>Limit</em> following it.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Suspend.htm">Suspend</a>: Making a hotkey or hotstring's first line a call to Suspend no longer automatically makes it exempt from suspension. Instead, use <code>#SuspendExempt</code> or the <code>S</code> option. The "Permit" parameter value is no longer valid.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Switch.htm">Switch</a> now performs case-sensitive comparison for strings by default, and has a <em>CaseSense</em> parameter which overrides the mode of case sensitivity and forces string (rather than numeric) comparison. Previously it was case-sensitive only if StringCaseSense was changed to On.</p>
<p><a href="lib/SysGet.htm">SysGet</a> now only has numeric sub-commands; its other sub-commands have been split into functions.  See <a href="#sub-commands">Sub-Commands</a> further below for details.</p>
<p>TrayTip's usage has changed to <code>TrayTip [Text, Title, Options]</code>. <em>Options</em> is a string of zero or more case-insensitive options delimited by a space or tab. The options are <code>Iconx</code>, <code>Icon!</code>, <code>Iconi</code>, <code>Mute</code> and/or any numeric value as before. TrayTip now shows even if <em>Text</em> is omitted (which is now harder to do by accident than in v1). The <em>Seconds</em> parameter no long exists (it had no effect on Windows Vista or later). Scripts may now use the NIIF_USER (0x4) and NIIF_LARGE_ICON (0x20) flags in combination (0x24) to include the large version of the tray icon in the notification. NIIF_USER (0x4) can also be used on its own for the small icon, but may not have consistent results across all OSes.</p>
<p>#Warn UseUnsetLocal and UseUnsetGlobal have been removed, as reading an unset variable now raises an error. <a href="lib/IsSet.htm">IsSet</a> can be used to avoid the error and <a href="lib/Try.htm">try</a>/<a href="lib/Catch.htm">catch</a> or <a href="lib/OnError.htm">OnError</a> can be used to handle it.</p>
<p><a href="lib/_Warn.htm#VarUnset">#Warn VarUnset</a> was added; it defaults to MsgBox. If not disabled, a warning is given for the first non-dynamic reference to each variable which is never used as the target of a direct, non-dynamic assignment or the reference operator (&amp;), or passed directly to IsSet.</p>
<p><a href="lib/_Warn.htm#Unreachable">#Warn Unreachable</a> no longer considers lines following an <code>Exit</code> call to be unreachable, as Exit is now an ordinary function.</p>
<p>#Warn ClassOverwrite has been removed, as top-level classes can no longer be overwritten by assignment. (However, they can now be implicitly shadowed by a local variable; that can be detected by #Warn LocalSameAsGlobal.)</p>
<p><a href="lib/WinActivate.htm">WinActivate</a> now sends <code>{Alt up}</code> after its first failed attempt at activating a window. Testing has shown this reduces the occurrence of flashing taskbar buttons. See the documentation for more details.</p>
<p><a href="lib/WinSetTitle.htm">WinSetTitle</a> and <a href="lib/WinMove.htm">WinMove</a> now use parameter order consistent with other Win functions; i.e. <em>WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</em> are always grouped together (at the end of the parameter list), to aide memorisation.</p>
<p>The <em>WinTitle</em> parameter of various functions can now accept a HWND (must be a pure integer) or an object with a <code>Hwnd</code> property, such as a Gui object. <code>DetectHiddenWindows</code> is ignored in such cases.</p>
<p><a href="lib/WinMove.htm">WinMove</a> no longer has special handling for the literal word <code class="no-highlight">DEFAULT</code>. Omit the parameter or specify an empty string instead (this works in both v1 and v2).</p>
<p><a href="lib/WinWait.htm">WinWait</a>, <a href="lib/WinWaitClose.htm">WinWaitClose</a>, <a href="lib/WinWaitActive.htm">WinWaitActive</a> and <a href="lib/WinWaitActive.htm">WinWaitNotActive</a> return non-zero if the wait finished (timeout did not expire). ErrorLevel was removed. WinWait and WinWaitActive return the HWND of the found window. WinWaitClose now sets the Last Found Window, so if WinWaitClose times out, it returns false and <code>WinExist()</code> returns the last window it found. For the timeout, specifying 0 is no longer the same as specifying 0.5; instead, it produces the shortest wait possible.</p>
<p><strong>Unsorted:</strong></p>
<p>A negative <em>StartingPos</em> for <a href="lib/InStr.htm">InStr</a>, <a href="lib/SubStr.htm">SubStr</a>, <a href="lib/RegExMatch.htm">RegExMatch</a> and <a href="lib/RegExReplace.htm">RegExReplace</a> is interpreted as a position from the end. Position -1 is the last character and position 0 is invalid (whereas in v1, position 0 was the last character).</p>
<p>Functions which previously accepted On/Off or On/Off/Toggle (but not other strings) now require 1/0/-1 instead.  On and Off would typically be replaced with <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.  Variables which returned On/Off now return 1/0, which are more useful in expressions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="lib/_UseHook.htm">#UseHook</a> and <a href="lib/_MaxThreadsBuffer.htm">#MaxThreadsBuffer</a> allow <code>1</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.
(Unlike the others, they do not actually support expressions.)</li>
<li><a href="lib/ListLines.htm">ListLines</a> allows blank or boolean.</li>
<li><a href="lib/ControlSetChecked.htm">ControlSetChecked</a>, <a href="lib/ControlSetEnabled.htm">ControlSetEnabled</a>, <a href="lib/Pause.htm">Pause</a>, <a href="lib/Suspend.htm">Suspend</a>, <a href="lib/WinSetAlwaysOnTop.htm">WinSetAlwaysOnTop</a>, and <a href="lib/WinSetEnabled.htm">WinSetEnabled</a> allow <code>1</code>, <code>0</code> and <code>-1</code>.</li>
<li><a href="Variables.htm#DetectHiddenWindows">A_DetectHiddenWindows</a>, <a href="Variables.htm#DetectHiddenText">A_DetectHiddenText</a>, and <a href="Variables.htm#StoreCapsLockMode">A_StoreCapsLockMode</a> use boolean (as do the corresponding functions).</li>
</ul>
<p>The following functions return a pure integer instead of a hexadecimal string:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="lib/ControlGetStyle.htm">ControlGetExStyle</a></li>

<li><a href="lib/WinGetControlsHwnd.htm">WinGetControlsHwnd</a> (within the Array)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="Variables.htm#ScriptHwnd">A_ScriptHwnd</a> also returns a pure integer.</p>
<h4 id="dllcall">DllCall</h4>
<p>If a type parameter is a variable, that variable's content is always used, never its name. In other words, unquoted type names are no longer supported - type names must be enclosed in quote marks.</p>
<p>When DllCall updates the length of a variable passed as Str or WStr, it now detects if the string was not properly null-terminated (likely indicating that buffer overrun has occurred), and terminates the program with an error message if so, as safe execution cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p><code>AStr</code> (without any suffix) is now input-only. Since the buffer is only ever as large as the input string, it was usually not useful for output parameters. This would apply to WStr instead of AStr if AutoHotkey is compiled for ANSI, but official v2 releases are only ever compiled for Unicode.</p>
<p>If a function writes a new address to a <code>Str*</code>, <code>AStr*</code> or <code>WStr*</code> parameter, DllCall now assigns the new string to the corresponding variable if one was supplied, instead of merely updating the length of the original string (which probably hasn't changed). Parameters of this type are usually not used to modify the input string, but rather to pass back a string at a new address.</p>
<p>DllCall now accepts an object for any <code>Ptr</code> parameter and the <em>Function</em> parameter; the object must have a <code>Ptr</code> property. For buffers allocated by the script, the new <code>Buffer</code> object is preferred over a variable. For <code>Ptr*</code>, the parameter's new value is assigned back to the object's <code>Ptr</code> property. This allows constructs such as <code>DllCall(..., "Ptr*", unk := IUnknown.new())</code>, which reduces repetition compared to <code>DllCall(..., "Ptr*", punk), unk := IUnknown.new(punk)</code>, and can be used to ensure any output from the function is properly freed (even if an exception is thrown due to the <code>HRESULT</code> return type, although typically the function would not output a non-null pointer in that case).</p>
<p>DllCall now requires the values of numeric-type parameters to be numeric, and will throw an exception if given a non-numeric or empty string. In particular, if the * or P suffix is used for output parameters, the output variable is required to be initialized.</p>
<p>The output value (if any) of numeric parameters with the * or P suffix is ignored if the script passes a plain variable containing a number. To receive the output value, pass a <code>VarRef</code> such as <code>&amp;myVar</code> or an object with a <code>Ptr</code> property.</p>
<p>The new <code>HRESULT</code> return type throws an exception if the function failed (<code>int &lt; 0</code> or <code>uint &amp; 0x80000000</code>). This should be used only with functions that actually return a <code>HRESULT</code>.</p>
<h4 id="loop-sub-commands">Loop Sub-commands</h4>
<p>The sub-command keyword must be written literally; it must not be enclosed in quote marks and cannot be a variable or expression. All other parameters are expressions. All loop sub-commands now support OTB.</p>
<p>Removed:</p>
<pre class="no-highlight">Loop, FilePattern [, IncludeFolders?, Recurse?]
Loop, RootKey [, Key, IncludeSubkeys?, Recurse?]
</pre>
<p>Use the following (added in v1.1.21) instead:</p>
<pre>Loop Files, FilePattern [, Mode]
Loop Reg, RootKey\Key [, Mode]
</pre>
<p>The comma after the second word is now optional.</p>
<p><a href="lib/LoopReg.htm#vars">A_LoopRegKey</a> now contains the root key and subkey, and A_LoopRegSubKey was removed.</p>
<h4 id="inputbox">InputBox</h4>
<pre>Obj := InputBox([Text, Title, Options, Default])
</pre>
<p>The <em>Options</em> parameter accepts a string of zero or more case-insensitive options delimited by a space or tab, similar to Gui control options. For example, this includes all supported options: <code>x0 y0 w100 h100 T10.0 Password*</code>. <code>T</code> is timeout and <code>Password</code> has the same usage as the equivalent Edit control option.</p>
<p>The width and height options now set the size of the client area (the area excluding the title bar and window frame), so are less theme-dependent.</p>
<p>The title will be blank if the <em>Title</em> parameter is an empty string. It defaults to <a href="Variables.htm#ScriptName">A_ScriptName</a> only when completely omitted, consistent with optional parameters of user-defined functions.</p>
<p><em>Obj</em> is an object with the properties <code>result</code> (containing "OK", "Cancel" or "Timeout") and <code>value</code>.</p>
<h4 id="msgbox">MsgBox</h4>
<pre>Result := MsgBox([Text, Title, Options])
</pre>
<p>The <em>Options</em> parameter accepts a string of zero or more case-insensitive options delimited by a space or tab, similar to Gui control options.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Iconx</code>, <code>Icon?</code>, <code>Icon!</code> and <code>Iconi</code> set the icon.</li>
<li><code class="no-highlight">Default</code> followed immediately by an integer sets the <em>n</em>th button as default.</li>
<li><code>T</code> followed immediately by an integer or floating-point number sets the timeout, in seconds.</li>
<li><code>Owner</code> followed immediately by a HWND sets the owner, overriding the Gui <code>+OwnDialogs</code> option.</li>
<li>One of the following mutually-exclusive strings sets the button choices: <code>OK</code>, <code>OKCancel</code>, <code>AbortRetryIgnore</code>, <code>YesNoCancel</code>, <code>YesNo</code>, <code>RetryCancel</code>, <code>CancelTryAgainContinue</code>, or just the initials separated by slashes (<code>o/c</code>, <code>y/n</code>, etc.), or just the initials without slashes.</li>
<li>Any numeric value, the same as in v1. Numeric values can be combined with string options, or <em>Options</em> can be a pure integer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The return value is the name of the button, without spaces. These are the same strings that were used with IfMsgBox in v1.</p>
<p>The title will be blank if the <em>Title</em> parameter is an empty string. It defaults to <a href="Variables.htm#ScriptName">A_ScriptName</a> only when completely omitted, consistent with optional parameters of user-defined functions.</p>
<h4 id="sub-commands">Sub-Commands</h4>
<p>Sub-commands of Control, ControlGet, Drive, DriveGet, WinGet, WinSet and Process have been replaced with individual functions, and the main commands have been removed. Names and usage have been changed for several of the functions. The new usage is shown below:</p>
<pre><em>; Where ... means optional Control, WinTitle, etc.</em>

Bool  := ControlGetChecked(...)

         ControlShowDropDown(...)
         ControlHideDropDown(...)
         ControlChooseIndex(Index, ...)  ; Also covers Tab
Index := ControlChooseString(Str, ...)

Index := ControlFindItem(Str, ...)
Index := ControlAddItem(Str, ...)
         ControlDeleteItem(Index, ...)

Int   := EditGetLineCount(...)
Int   := EditGetCurrentLine(...)

Str   := DriveGetLabel(Drive)
Str   := DriveGetSerial(Drive)
Str   := DriveGetType(Path)
Str   := DriveGetStatus(Path)

</pre>
<p><a href="lib/ProcessExist.htm">ProcessExist</a>, <a href="lib/ProcessClose.htm">ProcessClose</a>, <a href="lib/ProcessWait.htm">ProcessWait</a> and <a href="lib/ProcessWaitClose.htm">ProcessWaitClose</a> no longer set ErrorLevel; instead, they return the PID.</p>
<p>None of the other functions set ErrorLevel. Instead, they throw an exception on failure. In most cases failure is because the target window or control was not found.</p>
<p>HWNDs and styles are always returned as pure integers, not hexadecimal strings.</p>
<p><a href="lib/ControlChooseIndex.htm">ControlChooseIndex</a> allows 0 to deselect the current item/all items. It replaces "Control Choose", but also supports Tab controls.</p>
<p>"ControlGet Tab" was merged into <a href="lib/ControlGetIndex.htm">ControlGetIndex</a>, which also works with ListBox, ComboBox and DDL. For Tab controls, it returns 0 if no tab is selected (rare but valid). <a href="lib/ControlChooseIndex.htm">ControlChooseIndex</a> does not permit 0 for Tab controls since applications tend not to handle it.</p>
<p><a href="lib/ControlGetItems.htm">ControlGetItems</a> replaces "ControlGet List" for ListBox and ComboBox. It returns an Array.</p>
<p><a href="lib/DriveEject.htm">DriveEject</a> and <a href="lib/DriveEject.htm">DriveRetract</a> now use DeviceIoControl instead of mciSendString. DriveEject is therefore able to eject non-CD/DVD drives which have an "Eject" option in Explorer (i.e. removable drives but not external hard drives which show as fixed disks).</p>
<p><a href="lib/ListViewGetContent.htm">ListViewGetContent</a> replaces "ControlGet List" for ListView, and currently has the same usage as before.</p>
<p><a href="lib/WinGetList.htm">WinGetList</a>, <a href="lib/WinGetControls.htm">WinGetControls</a> and <a href="lib/WinGetControlsHwnd.htm">WinGetControlsHwnd</a> return arrays, not newline-delimited lists.</p>
<p><a href="lib/WinSetTransparent.htm">WinSetTransparent</a> treats <code>""</code> as <code>"Off"</code> rather than <code>0</code> (which would make the window invisible and unclickable).</p>
<p>Abbreviated aliases such as Topmost, Trans, FS and Cap were removed.</p>
<p>The following functions were formerly sub-commands of <a href="lib/SysGet.htm">SysGet</a>:</p>
<pre>Exists  := MonitorGet(N, Left, Top, Right, Bottom)
Exists  := MonitorGetWorkArea(N, Left, Top, Right, Bottom)
Count   := MonitorGetCount()
Primary := MonitorGetPrimary()
Name    := MonitorGetName(N)
</pre>
<h3 id="new-functions">New Functions</h3>
<p><code>Buffer(Size, FillByte)</code> (calling the Buffer class) creates and returns a <code>Buffer</code> object encapsulating a block of <em>Size</em> bytes of memory, initialized only if <em>FillByte</em> is specified. <code>BufferObj.Ptr</code> returns the address and <code>BufferObj.Size</code> returns or sets the size in bytes (reallocating the block of memory). Any object with Ptr and Size properties can be passed to <a href="lib/NumPut.htm">NumPut</a>, <a href="lib/NumGet.htm">NumGet</a>, <a href="lib/StrPut.htm">StrPut</a>, <a href="lib/StrGet.htm">StrGet</a>, <a href="lib/File.htm#RawRead">File.RawRead</a>, <a href="lib/File.htm#RawWrite">File.RawWrite</a> and <a href="lib/FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a>. Any object with a <code>Ptr</code> property can be passed to <a href="lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> parameters with <code>Ptr</code> type, <a href="lib/SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> and <a href="lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a>.</p>
<p><code>CaretGetPos([&amp;X, &amp;Y])</code> retrieves the current coordinates of the caret (text insertion point). This ensures the X and Y coordinates always match up, and there is no caching to cause unexpected behaviour (such as A_CaretX/Y returning a value that's not in the current CoordMode).</p>
<p><code>ClipboardAll([Data, Size])</code> creates an object containing everything on the clipboard (optionally accepting data previously retrieved from the clipboard instead of using the clipboard's current contents). The methods of reading and writing clipboard file data are different. The data format is the same, except that the data size is always 32-bit, so that the data is portable between 32-bit and 64-bit builds. See the v2 documentation for details.</p>
<p><code>ComCall(offset, comobj, ...)</code> is equivalent to <code>DllCall(NumGet(NumGet(comobj.ptr) + offset * A_Index), "ptr", comobj.ptr, ...)</code>, but with the return type defaulting to "hresult" rather than "int".</p>
<p><a href="lib/ComObject.htm">ComObject</a> (formerly ComObjCreate) and <a href="lib/ComObjQuery.htm">ComObjQuery</a> now return a wrapper object even if an IID is specified. ComObjQuery permits the first parameter to be any object with a <code>Ptr</code> property.</p>
<p><a href="lib/ControlGetClassNN.htm">ControlGetClassNN</a> returns the ClassNN of the specified control.</p>
<p><a href="lib/ControlSend.htm">ControlSendText</a>, equivalent to ControlSendRaw but using {Text} mode instead of {Raw} mode.</p>
<p><code>DirExist(Path)</code>, with usage similar to FileExist. Note that <code>InStr(FileExist(Pattern), "D")</code> only tells you whether the <em>first</em> matching file is a folder, not whether a folder exists.</p>
<p><code>Float(v)</code>: See <a href="#types">Types</a> further above.</p>
<p><code>InstallKeybdHook(Install := true, Force := false)</code> and <code>InstallMouseHook(Install := true, Force := false)</code> replace the corresponding directives, for increased flexibility.</p>
<p><code>Integer(v)</code>: See <a href="#types">Types</a> further above.</p>
<p id="isXXX"><a href="lib/Is.htm">isXXX</a>: The legacy command "if var is type" has been replaced with a series of functions: isAlnum, isAlpha, isDigit, isFloat, isInteger, isLower, isNumber, isSpace, isUpper, isXDigit. With the exception of isFloat, isInteger and isNumber, an exception is thrown if the parameter is not a string, as implicit conversion to string may cause counter-intuitive results.</p>
<p><code>IsSet(var)</code>, <code>IsSetRef(&amp;var)</code>: Returns true if the variable has been assigned a value (even if that value is an empty string), otherwise false. If false, attempting to read the variable within an expression would throw an error.</p>
<p><code>Menu()</code>/<code>MenuBar()</code> returns a new Menu/MenuBar object, which has the following members corresponding to v1 Menu sub-commands. Methods: <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Add">Add</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#AddStandard"><strong>Add</strong>Standard</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Check">Check</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Delete">Delete</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Disable">Disable</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Enable">Enable</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Insert">Insert</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Rename">Rename</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#SetColor"><strong>Set</strong>Color</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#SetIcon"><strong>Set</strong>Icon</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Show">Show</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#ToggleCheck">ToggleCheck</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#ToggleEnable">ToggleEnable</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Uncheck">Uncheck</a>. Properties: <a href="lib/Menu.htm#ClickCount">Click<strong>Count</strong></a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Default">Default</a>, <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Handle">Handle</a> (replaces MenuGetHandle). <a href="Variables.htm#TrayMenu">A_TrayMenu</a> also returns a Menu object. There is no UseErrorLevel mode, no global menu names, and no explicitly deleting the menu itself (that happens when all references are released; the <a href="lib/Menu.htm#Delete">Delete</a> method is equivalent to v1 DeleteAll). Labels are not supported, only function objects. The <a href="lib/Menu.htm#AddStandard">AddStandard</a> method adds the standard menu items and allows them to be individually modified as with custom items. Unlike v1, the Win32 menu is destroyed only when the object is deleted.</p>
<p><code>MenuFromHandle(Handle)</code> returns the Menu object corresponding to a Win32 menu handle, if it was created by AutoHotkey.</p>
<p><code>Number(v)</code>: See <a href="#types">Types</a> further above.</p>
<p><code>Persistent(Persist := true)</code> replaces the corresponding directive, increasing flexibility.</p>
<p><code>RegDeleteKey("RootKey\SubKey")</code> deletes a registry key. (RegDelete now only deletes values, except when omitting all parameters in a registry loop.)</p>
<p><a href="lib/Send.htm#SendText">SendText</a>, equivalent to SendRaw but using {Text} mode instead of {Raw} mode.</p>
<p><code>StrCompare(str1, str2 [, CaseSense := false])</code> returns -1 (str1 is less than str2), 0 (equal) or 1 (greater than). <em>CaseSense</em> can be "Locale".</p>
<p><code>String(v)</code>: See <a href="#types">Types</a> further above.</p>
<p><code>StrPtr(str)</code> returns the address of a string. Unlike address-of in v1, it can be used with literal strings and temporary strings.</p>
<p><code>SysGetIPAddresses()</code> returns an array of IP addresses, equivalent to the A_IPAddress variables which have been removed. Each reference to <code>A_IPAddress%N%</code> retrieved all addresses but returned only one, so retrieving multiple addresses took exponentially longer than necessary. The returned array can have zero or more elements.</p>
<p><code>TraySetIcon([FileName, IconNumber, Freeze])</code> replaces "Menu Tray, Icon".</p>
<p><code>VarSetStrCapacity(&amp;Var [, NewCapacity])</code> replaces the v1 VarSetCapacity, but is intended for use only with UTF-16 strings (such as to optimize repeated concatenation); therefore <em>NewCapacity</em> and the return value are in characters, not bytes.</p>
<p><code>VerCompare(A, B)</code> compares two version strings using the same algorithm as <a href="lib/_Requires.htm">#Requires</a>.</p>
<p><code>WinGetClientPos([&amp;X, &amp;Y, &amp;W, &amp;H, WinTitle, ...])</code> retrieves the position and size of the window's client area, in screen coordinates.</p>
<h3 id="new-directives">New Directives</h3>
<p><code>#DllLoad [FileOrDirName]</code>: Loads a DLL or EXE file before the script starts executing.</p>
<h3 id="built-in-variables">Built-in Variables</h3>
<p><a href="Variables.htm#AhkPath">A_AhkPath</a> always returns the path of the current executable/interpreter, even when the script is compiled. Previously it returned the path of the compiled script if a BIN file was used as the base file, but v2.0 releases no longer include BIN files.</p>
<p><a href="Variables.htm#IsCompiled">A_IsCompiled</a> returns 0 instead of "" if the script has not been compiled.</p>
<p><a href="Variables.htm#OSVersion">A_OSVersion</a> always returns a string in the format <code>major.minor.build</code>, such as <code>6.1.7601</code> for Windows 7 SP1. A_OSType has been removed as only NT-based systems are supported.</p>
<p><a href="Variables.htm#TimeSincePriorHotkey">A_TimeSincePriorHotkey</a> returns "" instead of -1 whenever <a href="Variables.htm#PriorHotkey">A_PriorHotkey</a> is "", and likewise for <a href="Variables.htm#TimeSinceThisHotkey">A_TimeSinceThisHotkey</a> when <a href="Variables.htm#ThisHotkey">A_ThisHotkey</a> is blank.</p>
<p>All built-in "virtual" variables now have the <code>A_</code> prefix (specifics below). Any predefined variables which lack this prefix (such as <code>Object</code>) are just global variables. The distinction may be important since it is currently impossible to take a reference to a virtual variable (except when passed directly to a built-in function); however, <a href="Variables.htm#Args">A_Args</a> is not a virtual variable.</p>
<p>Built-in variables which return numbers now return them as an <a href="Concepts.htm#numbers">integer</a> rather than a <a href="Concepts.htm#strings">string</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="built-in-objects">Built-in Objects</h3>
<p>File objects now strictly require property syntax when invoking properties and method syntax when invoking methods. For example, <code>File.Pos(n)</code> is not valid. An exception is thrown if there are too few or too many parameters, or if a read-only property is assigned a value.</p>
<p><code>File.Tell()</code> was removed.</p>
<p><code>Func.IsByRef()</code> now works with built-in functions.</p>
<h2 id="gui">Gui</h2>
<p>Gui, GuiControl and GuiControlGet were replaced with <a href="lib/Gui.htm#Call">Gui()</a> and <a href="lib/Gui.htm">Gui</a>/<a href="lib/GuiControl.htm">GuiControl</a> objects, which are generally more flexible, more consistent, and easier to use.</p>
<p>A GUI is typically not referenced by name/number (although it can still be named with <code>GuiObj.Name</code>). Instead, a GUI object (and window) is created explicitly by instantiating the <code>Gui</code> class, as in <code>GuiObj := Gui()</code>. This object has methods and properties which replace the Gui sub-commands. <code>GuiObj.Add()</code> returns a GuiControl object, which has methods and properties which replace the GuiControl and GuiControlGet commands. One can store this object in a variable, or use <code>GuiObj["Name"]</code> or <code>GuiCtrlFromHwnd(hwnd)</code> to retrieve the object. It is also passed as a parameter whenever an event handler (the replacement of a g-label) is called.</p>
<p>The usage of these methods and properties is not 1:1. Many parts have been revised to be more consistent and flexible, and to fix bugs or limitations.</p>
<p>There are no "default" GUIs, as the target Gui or control object is always specified. LV/TV/SB functions were replaced with methods (of the control object), making it much easier to use multiple ListViews/TreeViews.</p>
<p>There are no built-in variables containing information about events. The information is passed as parameters to the function/method which handles the event, including the source Gui or control.</p>
<p>Controls can still be named and be referenced by name, but it's just a name (used with <code>GuiObj["Name"]</code> and <code>GuiObj.Submit()</code>), not an associated variable, so there is no need to declare or create a global or static variable. The value is never stored in a variable automatically, but is accessible via <code>GuiCtrl.Value</code>. <code>GuiObj.Submit()</code> returns a new associative array using the control names as keys.</p>
<p>The v<em>Name</em> option now just sets the control's name to <em>Name</em>.</p>
<p>The +Hwnd<em>VarName</em> option has been removed in favour of <code>GuiCtrl.Hwnd</code>.</p>
<p>There are no more "g-labels" or labels/functions which automatically handle GUI events. The script must register for each event of interest by calling the <a href="lib/GuiOnEvent.htm">OnEvent</a> method of the Gui or GuiControl. For example, rather than checking <code>if (A_GuiEvent = "I" &amp;&amp; InStr(ErrorLevel, "F", true))</code> in a g-label, the script would register a handler for the <code>ItemFocus</code> event: <code>MyLV.OnEvent("ItemFocus", MyFunction)</code>. <em>MyFunction</em> would be called only for the ItemFocus event. It is not necessary to apply <code>AltSubmit</code> to enable additional events.</p>
<p>Arrays are used wherever a pipe-delimited list was previously used, such as to specify the items for a ListBox when creating it, when adding items, or when retrieving the selected items.</p>
<p>Scripts can define a class which extends <code>Gui</code> and handles its own events, keeping all of the GUI logic self-contained.</p>
<h3 id="gui-sub-commands">Gui sub-commands</h3>
<p><strong>Gui New</strong> → <a href="lib/Gui.htm#Call">Gui()</a>. Passing an empty title (not omitting it) now results in an empty title, not the default title.</p>
<p><strong>Gui Add</strong> → <a href="lib/Gui.htm#Add">GuiObj.Add() or GuiObj.Add<em>ControlType</em>()</a>; e.g. <code>GuiObj.Add("Edit")</code> or <code>GuiObj.AddEdit()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Gui Show</strong> → <a href="lib/Gui.htm#Show">GuiObj.Show()</a>, but it has no <em>Title</em> parameter. The title can be specified as a parameter of Gui() or via the GuiObj.Title property. The initial focus is still set to the first input-capable control with the WS_TABSTOP style (as per default message processing by the system), unless that's a Button control, in which case focus is now shifted to the Default button.</p>
<p><strong>Gui Submit</strong> → <a href="lib/Gui.htm#Submit">GuiObj.Submit()</a>. It works like before, except that Submit() creates and returns a new object which contains all of the "associated variables".</p>
<p><strong>Gui Destroy</strong> → <a href="lib/Gui.htm#Destroy">GuiObj.Destroy()</a>. The object still exists (until the script releases it) but cannot be used. A new GUI must be created (if needed). The window is also destroyed when the object is deleted, but the object is "kept alive" while the window is visible.</p>
<p><strong>Gui Font</strong> → <a href="lib/Gui.htm#SetFont">GuiObj.SetFont()</a>. It is also possible to set a control's font directly, with GuiCtrl.SetFont().</p>
<p><strong>Gui Color</strong> → <a href="lib/Gui.htm#BackColor">GuiObj.BackColor</a> sets/returns the background color. <em>ControlColor</em> (the second parameter) is not supported, but all controls which previously supported it can have a background set by the <code>+Background</code> option instead. Unlike "Gui Color", GuiObj.BackColor does not affect Progress controls or disabled/read-only Edit, DDL, ComboBox or TreeView (with -Theme) controls.</p>
<p><strong>Gui Margin</strong> → <a href="lib/Gui.htm#MarginX">GuiObj.MarginX</a> and <a href="lib/Gui.htm#MarginY">GuiObj.MarginY</a> properties.</p>
<p><strong>Gui Menu</strong> → <a href="lib/Gui.htm#MenuBar">GuiObj.MenuBar</a> sets/returns a MenuBar object created with <code>MenuBar()</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Gui Cancel/Hide/Minimize/Maximize/Restore</strong> → Gui methods of the same name.</p>
<p><strong>Gui Flash</strong> → <a href="lib/Gui.htm#Flash">GuiObj.Flash()</a>, but use <code>false</code> instead of <code>Off</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Gui Tab</strong> → <a href="lib/GuiControl.htm#UseTab">TabControl.UseTab()</a>. Defaults to matching a prefix of the tab name as before. Pass true for the second parameter to match the whole tab name, but unlike the v1 "Exact" mode, it is case-insensitive.</p>
<h3 id="events">Events</h3>
<p>See <a href="lib/GuiOnEvent.htm#Events">Events (OnEvent)</a> for details of all explicitly supported GUI and GUI control events.</p>
<p>The Size event passes 0, -1 or 1 (consistent with <a href="lib/WinGetMinMax.htm">WinGetMinMax</a>) instead of 0, 1 or 2.</p>
<p>The ContextMenu event can be registered for each control, or for the whole GUI.</p>
<p>The DropFiles event swaps the <em>FileArray</em> and <em>Ctrl</em> parameters, to be consistent with ContextMenu.</p>
<p>The ContextMenu and DropFiles events use client coordinates instead of window coordinates (Client is also the default <a href="lib/CoordMode.htm">CoordMode</a> in v2).</p>
<p>The following control events were removed, but detecting them is a simple case of passing the appropriate numeric notification code (defined in the Windows SDK) to <a href="lib/GuiOnNotify.htm">GuiCtrl.OnNotify()</a>: K, D, d, A, S, s, M, C, E and MonthCal's 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Control events do not pass the event name as a parameter (GUI events never did).</p>
<p>Custom's N and Normal events were replaced with <a href="lib/GuiOnNotify.htm">GuiCtrl.OnNotify()</a> and <a href="lib/GuiOnCommand.htm">GuiCtrl.OnCommand()</a>, which can be used with any control.</p>
<p>Link's Click event passes "Ctrl, ID or Index, HREF" instead of "Ctrl, Index, HREF or ID", and does not automatically execute HREF if a Click callback is registered.</p>
<p>ListView's Click, DoubleClick and ContextMenu (when triggered by a right-click) events now report the item which was clicked (or 0 if none) instead of the focused item.</p>
<p>ListView's I event was split into multiple named events, except for the f (de-focus) event, which was excluded because it is implied by F (ItemFocus).</p>
<p>ListView's e (ItemEdit) event is ignored if the user cancels.</p>
<p>Slider's Change event is raised more consistently than the v1 g-label; i.e. it no longer ignores changes made by the mouse wheel by default. See <a href="lib/GuiControls.htm#slider-change">Detecting Changes (Slider)</a> for details.</p>
<p>The BS_NOTIFY style is now added automatically as needed for Button, CheckBox and Radio controls. It is no longer applied by default to Radio controls.</p>
<p>Focus (formerly F) and LoseFocus (formerly f) are supported by more (but not all) control types.</p>
<p>Setting an Edit control's text with Edit.Value or Edit.Text does not trigger the control's Change event, whereas GuiControl would trigger the control's g-label.</p>
<p>LV/TV.Add/Modify now suppress item-change events, so such events should only be raised by user action or SendMessage.</p>
<h3 id="removed">Removed</h3>
<p>+Delimiter<br>
+Hwnd<em>OutputVar</em> (use <a href="lib/Gui.htm#Hwnd">GuiObj.Hwnd</a> or <a href="lib/GuiControl.htm#Hwnd">GuiCtrl.Hwnd</a> instead)<br>
+Label<br>
+LastFoundExist<br>
Gui GuiName: Default</p>
<h3 id="control-options">Control Options</h3>
<p>+/-Background is interpreted and supported more consistently. All controls which supported "Gui Color" now support <code>+Background<i>Color</i></code> and <code>+BackgroundDefault</code> (synonymous with <code>-Background</code>), not just ListView/TreeView/StatusBar/Progress.</p>
<p><a href="lib/Gui.htm#Add">GuiObj.Add</a> defaults to <code>y+m</code>/<code>x+m</code> instead of <code>yp</code>/<code>xp</code> when <code>xp</code>/<code>yp</code> or <code>xp+0</code>/<code>yp+0</code> is used. In other words, the control is placed below/to the right of the previous control instead of at exactly the same position. If a non-zero offset is used, the behaviour is the same as in v1. To use exactly the same position, specify <code>xp yp</code> together.</p>
<p><code>x+m</code> and <code>y+m</code> can be followed by an additional offset, such as <code>x+m+10</code> (<code>x+m10</code> is also valid, but less readable).</p>
<p><code>Choose</code> no longer serves as a redundant (undocumented) way to specify the value for a MonthCal. Just use the <em>Text</em> parameter, as before.</p>
<h3 id="guicontrolget">GuiControlGet</h3>
<h4 id="empty-sub-command">Empty sub-command</h4>
<p>GuiControlGet's empty sub-command had two modes: the default mode, and text mode, where the fourth parameter was the word <code>Text</code>. If a control type had no single "value", GuiControlGet defaulted to returning the result of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getwindowtexta">GetWindowText</a> (which isn't always visible text). Some controls had no visible text, or did not support retrieving it, so completely ignored the fourth parameter. By contrast, <a href="lib/GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a> returns display text, hidden text (the same text returned by ControlGetText) or nothing at all.</p>
<p>The table below shows the closest equivalent property or function for each mode of GuiControlGet and control type.</p>

<p>ActiveX: <a href="lib/GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> returns the same object each time, whereas GuiControlGet created a new wrapper object each time. Consequently, it is no longer necessary to retain a reference to an ActiveX object for the purpose of keeping a <a href="lib/ComObjConnect.htm">ComObjConnect</a> connection alive.</p>

<p>Progress Gui controls no longer have the PBS_SMOOTH style by default, so they are now styled according to the system visual style.</p>
<p>The default margins and control sizes (particularly for Button controls) may differ slightly from v1 when DPI is greater than 100%.</p>
<p>Picture controls no longer delete their current image when they fail to set a new image via <code>GuiCtrl.Value := "new image.png"</code>. However, removing the current image with <code>GuiCtrl.Value := ""</code> is permitted.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p><a href="lib/OnError.htm">OnError</a> is now called for critical errors prior to exiting the script. Although the script might not be in a state safe for execution, the attempt is made, consistent with OnExit.</p>
<p>Runtime errors no longer set <code>Exception.What</code> to the currently running user-defined function or sub (but this is still done when calling <code>Error()</code> without the second parameter). This gives <code>What</code> a clearer purpose: a function name indicates a failure of that function (not a failure to call the function or evaluate its parameters). <code>What</code> is blank for expression evaluation and control flow errors (some others may also be blank).</p>
<p>Exception objects thrown by runtime errors can now be identified as instances of the new Error class or a more specific subclass. Error objects have a <code>Stack</code> property containing a stack trace. If the <em>What</em> parameter specifies the name of a running function, <em>File</em> and <em>Line</em> are now set based on which line called that function.</p>
<p>Try-catch syntax has changed to allow the script to catch specific error classes, while leaving others uncaught. See <a href="#catch">Catch</a> below for details.</p>
<h3 id="continuable-errors">Continuable Errors</h3>
<p>In most cases, error dialogs now provide the option to continue the current thread (vs. exiting the thread).  COM errors now exit the thread when choosing not to continue (vs. exiting the entire script).</p>
<p>Scripts should not rely on this: If the error was raised by a built-in function, continuing causes it to return "". If the error was raised by the expression evaluator (such as for an invalid dynamic reference or divide by zero), the expression is aborted and yields "" (if used as a control flow statement's parameter).</p>
<p>In some cases the code does not support continuation, and the option to continue should not be shown. The option is also not shown for critical errors, which are designed to terminate the script.</p>
<p><a href="lib/OnError.htm">OnError</a> callbacks now take a second parameter, containing one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Return": Returning -1 will continue the thread, while 0 and 1 act as before.</li>
<li>"Exit": Continuation not supported. Returning non-zero stops further processing but still exits the thread.</li>
<li>"ExitApp": This is a critical error. Returning non-zero stops further processing but the script is still terminated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="errorlevel">ErrorLevel</h3>
<p>ErrorLevel has been removed. Scripts are often (perhaps usually) written without error-checking, so the policy of setting ErrorLevel for errors often let them go undetected. An immediate error message may seem a bit confrontational, but is generally more helpful.</p>
<p>Where ErrorLevel was previously set to indicate an error condition, an exception is thrown instead, with a (usually) more helpful error message.</p>
<p>Commands such as "Process Exist" which used it to return a value now simply return that value (e.g. <code>pid := ProcessExist()</code>) or something more useful (e.g. <code>hwnd := GroupActivate(group)</code>).</p>
<p>In some cases ErrorLevel was used for a secondary return value.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="lib/Sort.htm">Sort</a> with the U option no longer returns the number of duplicates removed.</li>
<li><code>Input</code> was removed. It was superseded by InputHook. A few lines of code can make a simple replacement which returns an InputHook object containing the results instead of using ErrorLevel and an OutputVar.</li>
<li><a href="lib/InputBox.htm">InputBox</a> returns an object with <code>result</code> (OK, Cancel or Timeout) and <code>value</code> properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>File functions which previously stored the number of failures in ErrorLevel now throw it in the <code>Extra</code> property of the thrown exception object.</p>
<p><a href="lib/SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> timeout is usually an anomolous condition, so causes a <code>TimeoutError</code> to be thrown. <code>TargetError</code> and <code>OSError</code> may be thrown under other conditions.</p>
<p>The <code>UseErrorLevel</code> modes of the <a href="lib/Run.htm">Run</a> and <a href="lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> functions were removed.  This mode predates the addition of <code>Try</code>/<code>Catch</code> to the language.  Menu and Gui had this mode as well but were replaced with objects (which do not use ErrorLevel).</p>
<h3 id="expressions-1">Expressions</h3>
<p>A load-time error is raised for more syntax errors than in v1, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empty parentheses (except adjoining a function name); e.g. <code>x ()</code></li>
<li>Prefix operator used on the wrong side or lacking an operand; e.g. <code>x!</code></li>
<li>Binary operator with less than two operands.</li>
<li>Ternary operator with less than three operands.</li>
<li>Target of assignment not a writable variable or property.</li>
</ul>
<p>An exception is thrown when any of the following failures occur (instead of ignoring the failure or producing an empty string):</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempting math on a non-numeric value. (Numeric strings are okay.)</li>
<li>Divide by zero or other invalid/unsupported input, such as <code>(-1)**1.5</code>. Note that some cases are newly detected as invalid, such as <code>0**0</code> and <code>a&lt;&lt;b</code> or <code>a&gt;&gt;b</code> where <code>b</code> is not in the range 0..63.</li>
<li>Failure to allocate memory for a built-in function's return value, concatenation or the expression's result.</li>
<li>Stack underflow (typically caused by a syntax error).</li>
<li>Attempted assignment to something which isn't a variable (or array element).</li>
<li>Attempted assignment to a read-only variable.</li>
<li>Attempted double-deref with an empty name, such as <code>fn(%empty%)</code>.</li>
<li>Failure to execute a dynamic function call or method call.</li>
<li>A method/property invocation fails because the value does not implement that method/property.  (For associative arrays in v1, only a method call can cause this.)</li>
<li>An object-assignment fails due to memory allocation failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the conditions above are detected in v1, but not mid-expression; for instance, <code>A_AhkPath := x</code> is detected in v1 but <code>y := x, A_AhkPath := x</code> is only detected in v2.</p>
<p>Standalone use of the operators <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>--</code> and <code>++</code> no longer treats an empty variable as 0. This differs from v1, where they treated an empty variable as 0 when used standalone, but not mid-expression or with multi-statement comma.</p>
<h3 id="functions-1">Functions</h3>
<p>Functions generally throw an exception on failure. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Errors due to incorrect use of <a href="lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>, <a href="lib/RegExMatch.htm">RegExMatch</a> and <a href="lib/RegExReplace.htm">RegExReplace</a> were fairly common due to their complexity, and (like many errors) are easier to detect and debug if an error message is shown immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="lib/Math.htm">Math functions</a> throw an exception if any of their inputs are non-numeric, or if the operation is invalid (such as division by zero).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functions with a <em>WinTitle</em> parameter (with exceptions, such as <a href="lib/WinClose.htm">WinClose</a>'s ahk_group mode) throw if the target window or control is not found.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions are thrown for some errors that weren't previously detected, and some conditions that were incorrectly marked as errors (previously by setting ErrorLevel) were fixed.</p>
<p>Some error messages have been changed.</p>
<h3 id="catch">Catch</h3>
<p>The syntax for <a href="lib/Catch.htm">Catch</a> has been changed to provide a way to catch specific error classes, while leaving others uncaught (to transfer control to another Catch further up the call stack, or report the error and exit the thread). Previously this required catching thrown values of all types, then checking type and re-throwing. For example:</p>
<pre><em>; Old (uses obsolete v2.0-a rules for demonstration since v1 had no `is` or Error classes)</em>
try
    SendMessage msg,,, "Control1", "The Window"
catch err
    if err is TimeoutError
        MsgBox "The Window is unresponsive"
    else
        throw err

<em>; New</em>
try
    SendMessage msg,,, "Control1", "The Window"
catch TimeoutError
    MsgBox "The Window is unresponsive"
</pre>
<p>Variations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>catch</code> catches an Error instance.</li>
<li><code>catch as err</code> catches an Error instance, which is assigned to err.</li>
<li><code>catch ValueError as err</code> catches a ValueError instance, which is assigned to err.</li>
<li><code>catch ValueError, TypeError</code> catches either type.</li>
<li><code>catch ValueError, TypeError as err</code> catches either type and assigns the instance to err.</li>
<li><code>catch Any</code> catches anything.</li>
<li><code>catch (MyError as err)</code> permits parentheses, like most other control flow statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>try</code> is used without <code>finally</code> or <code>catch</code>, it acts as though it has a <code>catch</code> with an empty block. Although that sounds like v1, now <code>catch</code> on its own only catches instances of <code>Error</code>. In most cases, <code>try</code> on its own is meant to suppress an Error, so no change needs to be made. However, the direct equivalent of v1 <code>try something()</code> in v2 is:</p>
<pre>try something()
catch Any
{}
</pre>
<p>Prioritising the error type over the output variable name might encourage better code; handling the expected error as intended without suppressing or mishandling unexpected errors that should have been reported.</p>
<p>As values of all types can be thrown, any class is valid for the filter (e.g. <code>String</code> or <code>Map</code>). However, the class prototypes are resolved at load time, and must be specified as a full class name and not an arbitrary expression (similar to <code>y</code> in <code>class x extends y</code>).</p>
<p>While a <code>catch</code> statement is executing, <code>throw</code> can be used without parameters to re-throw the exception (avoiding the need to specify an output variable just for that purpose). This is supported even within a nested <code>try</code>...<code>finally</code>, but not within a nested <code>try</code>...<code>catch</code>. The <code>throw</code> does not need to be physically contained by the <code>catch</code> statement's body; it can be used by a called function.</p>
<p>An <code>else</code> can be present after the last <code>catch</code>; this is executed if no exception is thrown within <code>try</code>.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-mouse-hotkeys-and-hotstrings">Keyboard, Mouse, Hotkeys and Hotstrings</h2>
<p>Fewer VK to SC and SC to VK mappings are hard-coded, in theory improving compatibility with non-conventional custom keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>The key names "Return" and "Break" were removed. Use "Enter" and "Pause" instead.</p>
<p>The presence of <kbd>AltGr</kbd> on each keyboard layout is now always detected by reading the KLLF_ALTGR flag from the keyboard layout DLL. (v1.1.28+ Unicode builds already use this method.) The fallback methods of detecting <kbd>AltGr</kbd> via the keyboard hook have been removed.</p>
<p>Mouse wheel hotkeys set <a href="Variables.htm#EventInfo">A_EventInfo</a> to the wheel delta as reported by the mouse driver instead of dividing by 120. Generally it is a multiple of 120, but some mouse hardware/drivers may report wheel movement at a higher resolution.</p>
<p>Hotstrings now treat <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> the same as <kbd>Backspace</kbd>, instead of transcribing it to <code>`b</code> within the hotstring buffer.</p>
<p>Hotstrings use the first pair of colons (<code class="no-highlight">::</code>) as a delimiter rather than the last when multiple pairs of colons are present. In other words, colons (when adjacent to another colon) must be escaped in the trigger text in v2, whereas in v1 they must be escaped in the replacement. Note that with an odd number of consecutive colons, the previous    behaviour did not consider the final colon as part of a pair. For example, there is no change in behaviour for <code class="no-highlight">::1:::2</code> (<code class="no-highlight">1</code> → <code class="no-highlight">:2</code>), but <code class="no-highlight">::3::::4</code> is now <code class="no-highlight">3</code> → <code class="no-highlight">::4</code> rather than <code class="no-highlight">3::</code> → <code class="no-highlight">4</code>.</p>
<p>Hotstrings no longer escape colons in pairs, which means it is now possible to escape a single colon at the end of the hotstring trigger. For example, <code class="no-highlight">::5`:::6</code> is now <code class="no-highlight">5:</code> → <code class="no-highlight">6</code> rather than an error, and <code class="no-highlight">::7`::::8</code> is now <code class="no-highlight">7:</code> → <code class="no-highlight">:8</code> rather than <code class="no-highlight">7::</code> → <code class="no-highlight">8</code>. It is best to escape every literal colon in these cases to avoid confusion (but a single isolated colon need not be escaped).</p>
<p>Hotstrings with continuation sections now default to Text mode instead of Raw mode.</p>
<p>Hotkeys now mask the Win/Alt key on release only if it is logically down and the hotkey requires the Win/Alt key (with <code>#</code>/<code>!</code> or a custom prefix). That is, hotkeys which do not require the Win/Alt key no longer mask Win/Alt-up when the Win/Alt key is physically down. This allows hotkeys which send <code>{Blind}{LWin up}</code> to activate the Start menu (which was already possible if using a remapped key such as <code>AppsKey::RWin</code>).</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>Windows 2000 and Windows XP support has been dropped.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey no longer overrides the system <code>ForegroundLockTimeout</code> setting at startup.</p>
<ul>
<li>This was done by calling <code>SystemParametersInfo</code> with the <code>SPI_SETFOREGROUNDLOCKTIMEOUT</code> action, which affects all applications for the current user session. It does not persist after logout, but was still undesirable to some users.</li>
<li>User bug reports (and simple logic) indicate that if it works, it allows the focus to be stolen by programs which aren't specifically designed to do so.</li>
<li>Some testing on Windows 10 indicated that it had no effect on anything; calls to <code>SetForegroundWindow</code> always failed, and other workarounds employed by WinActivate were needed and effective regardless of timeout. <code>SPI_GETFOREGROUNDLOCKTIMEOUT</code> was used from a separate process to verify that the change took effect (it sometimes doesn't).</li>
<li>It can be replicated in script easily:
<pre>DllCall("SystemParametersInfo", "int", 0x2001, "int", 0, "ptr", 0, "int", 2)</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>RegEx newline matching defaults to (*ANYCRLF) and (*BSR_ANYCRLF); `r and `n are recognized in addition to `r`n. The `a option implicitly enables (*BSR_UNICODE).</p>
<p>RegEx callout functions can now be variadic. Callouts specified via a <code>pcre_callout</code> variable can be any callable object, or <code>pcre_callout</code> itself can be directly defined as a function (perhaps a nested function). As the function and variable <a href="#scope">namespaces were merged</a>, a callout pattern such as <code>(?C:fn)</code> can also refer to a local or global variable containing a function object, not just a user-defined function.</p>
<p>Scripts read from stdin (e.g. with <code>AutoHotkey.exe *</code>) no longer include the initial working directory in <a href="Variables.htm#ScriptFullPath">A_ScriptFullPath</a> or the main window's title, but it is used as <a href="Variables.htm#ScriptDir">A_ScriptDir</a> and to locate the local Lib folder.</p>
<p>Settings changed by the auto-execute thread now become the default settings immediately (for threads launched after that point), rather than after 100ms and then again when the auto-execute thread finishes.</p>
<p>The following limits have been removed by utilizing dynamic allocations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum line or continuation section length of 16,383 characters.</li>
<li>Maximum 512 tokens per expression (MAX_TOKENS).<br>
Arrays internal to the expression evaluator which were sized based on MAX_TOKENS are now based on precalculated estimates of the required sizes, so performance should be similar but stack usage is somewhat lower in most cases. This might increase the maximum recursion depth of user-defined functions.</li>
<li>Maximum 512 var or function references per arg (but MAX_TOKENS was more limiting for expressions anyway).</li>
<li>Maximum 255 specified parameter values per function call (but MAX_TOKENS was more limiting anyway).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="lib/ListVars.htm">ListVars</a> now shows static variables separately to local variables. Global variables declared within the function are also listed as static variables (this is a side-effect of new implementation details, but is kept as it might be useful in scripts with many global variables).</p>
<p>The (undocumented?) "lazy var" optimization was removed to reduce code size and maintenance costs. This optimization improved performance of scripts with more than 100,000 variables.</p>
<p><a href="Program.htm#tray-icon">Tray menu</a>: The word "This" was removed from "Reload This Script" and "Edit This Script", for consistency with "Pause Script" and the main window's menu options.</p>
<p>YYYYMMDDHH24MISS timestamp values are now considered invalid if their length is not an even number between 4 and 14 (inclusive).</p>
<h3 id="persistence">Persistence</h3>
<p>Scripts are "<a href="lib/Persistent.htm">persistent</a>" while at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one hotkey or hotstring has been defined by the script.</li>
<li>At least one <a href="lib/Gui.htm">Gui</a> (or the script's <a href="Program.htm#main-window">main window</a>) is visible.</li>
<li>At least one script <a href="lib/SetTimer.htm">timer</a> is currently enabled.</li>
<li>At least one <a href="lib/OnClipboardChange.htm">OnClipboardChange</a> callback function has been set.</li>
<li>At least one <a href="lib/InputHook.htm">InputHook</a> is active.</li>
<li><code>Persistent()</code> or <code>Persistent(true)</code> was called and not reversed by calling <code>Persistent(false)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If one of the following occurs and none of the above conditions are satisfied, the script terminates.</p>
<ul>
<li>The last script thread finishes.</li>
<li>A <a href="lib/Gui.htm">Gui</a> is closed or destroyed.</li>
<li>The script's <a href="Program.htm#main-window">main window</a> is closed (but destroying it causes the script to exit regardless of persistence, as before).</li>
<li>An <a href="lib/InputHook.htm">InputHook</a> with no <a href="lib/InputHook.htm#OnEnd">OnEnd</a> callback ends.</li>
</ul>
<p>For flexibility, <a href="lib/OnMessage.htm">OnMessage</a> does not make the script automatically persistent.</p>
<p>By contrast, v1 scripts are "persistent" when at least one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one hotkey or hotstring has been defined by the script.</li>
<li>Gui or OnMessage() appears anywhere in the script.</li>
<li>The keyboard hook or mouse hook is installed.</li>
<li>Input has been called.</li>
<li>#Persistent was used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="threads">Threads</h3>
<p><a href="misc/Threads.htm">Threads</a> start out with an uninterruptible timeout of 17ms instead of 15ms. 15 was too low since the system tick count updates in steps of 15 or 16 minimum; i.e. if the tick count updated at exactly the wrong moment, the thread could become interruptible even though virtually no time had passed.</p>
<p>Threads which start out uninterruptible now remain so until at least one line has executed, even if the uninterruptible timeout expires first (such as if the system suspends the process immediately after the thread starts in order to give CPU time to another process).</p>
<p><a href="lib/_MaxThreads.htm">#MaxThreads</a> and <a href="lib/_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> no longer make exceptions for any subroutine whose first line is one of the following functions: <a href="lib/ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a>, <a href="lib/Pause.htm">Pause</a>, <a href="lib/Edit.htm">Edit</a>, <a href="lib/Reload.htm">Reload</a>, <a href="lib/KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a>, <a href="lib/ListLines.htm">ListLines</a>, <a href="lib/ListVars.htm">ListVars</a>, or <a href="lib/ListHotkeys.htm">ListHotkeys</a>.</p>
<h3 id="default-settings">Default Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li id="NoEnv">#NoEnv is the default behaviour, so the directive itself has been removed. Use <a href="lib/EnvGet.htm">EnvGet</a> instead if an equivalent built-in variable is not available.</li>
<li><a href="lib/SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> defaults to Input instead of Event.</li>
<li><a href="lib/SetTitleMatchMode.htm">Title matching mode</a> defaults to 2 instead of 1.</li>
<li id="SetBatchLines">SetBatchLines has been removed, so all scripts run at full speed (equivalent to SetBatchLines -1 in v1).</li>
<li>The working directory defaults to <a href="Variables.htm#ScriptDir">A_ScriptDir</a>. <a href="Variables.htm#InitialWorkingDir">A_InitialWorkingDir</a> contains the working directory which was set by the process which launched AutoHotkey.</li>
<li><a href="lib/_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a> prompt behaviour is default for all scripts; #SingleInstance on its own activates Force mode. <code>#SingleInstance Prompt</code> can also be used explicitly, for clarity or to override a previous directive.</li>
<li><a href="lib/CoordMode.htm">CoordMode</a> defaults to Client (added in v1.1.05) instead of Window.</li>
<li>The default codepage for script files (but not files read <em>by</em> the script) is now UTF-8 instead of ANSI (CP0). This can be overridden with the /CP command line switch, as before.</li>
<li id="MaxMem">#MaxMem was removed, and no artificial limit is placed on variable capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="command-line">Command Line</h3>
<p>Command-line args are no longer stored in a pseudo-array of numbered global vars; the global variable <a href="Variables.htm#Args">A_Args</a> (added in v1.1.27) should be used instead.</p>
<p>The /R and /F switches were removed. Use /restart and /force instead.</p>
<p>/validate should be used in place of /iLib when AutoHotkey.exe is being used to check a script for syntax errors, as the function library auto-include mechanism was removed.</p>
<p>/ErrorStdOut is now treated as one of the script's parameters, not built-in, in either of the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the script is compiled, unless /script is used.</li>
<li>When it has a suffix not beginning with <code>=</code> (where previously the suffix was ignored).</li>
</ul>

<span id="Variables"></span><h2 id="Intro">Variables</h2>
<p>See <a href="Concepts.htm#variables">Variables</a> for general explanation and details about how variables work.</p>
<p id="assigning"><strong>Storing values in variables</strong>: To store a string or number in a variable, use the <a href="#AssignOp">colon-equal operator (:=)</a> followed by a number, quoted string or any other type of <a href="Language.htm#expressions">expression</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>MyNumber := 123
MyString := "This is a literal string."
CopyOfVar := Var</pre>
<p>A variable cannot be explicitly deleted, but its previous value can be released by assigning a new value, such as an empty string:</p>
<pre>MyVar := ""</pre>
<p>A variable can also be assigned a value indirectly, by <a href="#ref">taking its reference</a> and using a <a href="#deref">double-deref</a> or passing it to a function. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="lib/MouseGetPos.htm">MouseGetPos</a> &amp;x, &amp;y</pre>
<p>Reading the value of a variable which has not been assigned a value is considered an error. <a href="lib/IsSet.htm">IsSet</a> can be used to detect this condition.</p>
<p id="retrieving"><strong>Retrieving the contents of variables</strong>: To include the contents of a variable in a string, use <a href="#concat">concatenation</a> or <a href="lib/Format.htm">Format</a>. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="lib/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a> "The value of Var is " . Var . "."
MsgBox "The value in the variable named Var is " Var "."
MsgBox Format("Var has the value {1}.", Var)
</pre>
<p>Sub-expressions can be combined with strings in the same way. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox("The sum of X and Y is " . (X + Y))
</pre>
<p><strong>Comparing variables</strong>: Please read the expressions section below for important notes about the different kinds of comparisons.</p>
<h2 id="Expressions">Expressions</h2>
<p class="note">See <a href="Language.htm#expressions">Expressions</a> for a structured overview and further explanation.</p>
<p>Expressions are used to perform one or more operations upon a series of variables, literal strings, and/or literal numbers.</p>
<p>Plain words in expressions are interpreted as variable names. Consequently, literal strings must be enclosed in double quotes to distinguish them from variables. For example:</p>
<pre>if (CurrentSetting &gt; 100 or FoundColor != "Blue")
    MsgBox "The setting is too high or the wrong color is present."</pre>
<p>In the example above, "Blue" appears in quotes because it is a literal string. Single-quote marks (&apos;) and double-quote marks (") function identically, except that a string enclosed in single-quote marks can contain literal double-quote marks and vice versa. Therefore, to include an <em>actual</em> quote mark inside a literal string, <a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm">escape</a> the quote mark or enclose the string in the opposite type of quote mark. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox "She said, <span class="red">`"</span>An apple a day.<span class="red">`"</span>"
MsgBox <span class="red">&apos;</span>She said, "An apple a day."<span class="red">&apos;</span></pre>
<p><strong>Empty strings</strong>: To specify an empty string in an expression, use an empty pair of quotes. For example, the statement <code>if (MyVar != "")</code> would be true if <em>MyVar</em> is not blank.</p>
<p><strong>Storing the result of an expression</strong>: To assign a result to a variable, use the <a href="#AssignOp">:= operator</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>NetPrice := Price * (1 - Discount/100)</pre>
<p id="Boolean"><strong>Boolean values</strong>: When an expression is required to evaluate to true or false (such as an IF-statement), a blank or zero result is considered false and all other results are considered true. For example, the statement <code>if ItemCount</code> would be false only if ItemCount is blank or 0. Similarly, the expression <code>if not ItemCount</code> would yield the opposite result.</p>
<p>Operators such as NOT/&gt;/=/&lt; automatically produce a true or false value: they yield 1 for true and 0 for false. However, the AND/OR operators always produce one of the input values. For example, in the following expression, the variable <em>Done</em> is assigned 1 if A_Index is greater than 5 or the value of <em>FoundIt</em> in all other cases:</p>
<pre>Done := A_Index &gt; 5 or FoundIt</pre>
<p>As hinted above, a variable can be used to hold a false value simply by making it blank or assigning 0 to it. To take advantage of this, the shorthand statement <code>if Done</code> can be used to check whether the variable Done is true or false.</p>
<p><span id="True"></span><span id="False"></span>In an expression, the keywords <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> resolve to 1 and 0. They can be used to make a script more readable as in these examples:</p>
<pre>CaseSensitive := false
ContinueSearch := true</pre>
<p id="numbers"><strong>Integers and floating point</strong>: Within an expression, numbers are considered to be floating point if they contain a decimal point or scientific notation; otherwise, they are integers. For most operators -- such as addition and multiplication -- if either of the inputs is a floating point number, the result will also be a floating point number.</p>
<p>Within expressions and non-expressions alike, integers may be written in either hexadecimal or decimal format. Hexadecimal numbers all start with the prefix 0x. For example, <code>Sleep 0xFF</code> is equivalent to <code>Sleep 255</code>. Floating point numbers can optionally be written in scientific notation, with or without a decimal point (e.g. <code>1e4</code> or <code>-2.1E-4</code>).</p>
<p>Within expressions, unquoted literal numbers such as <code>128</code>, <code>0x7F</code> and <code>1.0</code> are converted to pure numbers before the script begins executing, so converting the number to a string may produce a value different to the original literal value. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox(0x7F)  <em>; Shows 128</em>
MsgBox(1.00)  <em>; Shows 1.0</em></pre>

      <p><strong>Dereference</strong> or <strong>name substitution</strong>.</p>
      <p>When <em>Expr</em> evaluates to a <a href="Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a>, <code>%Expr%</code> accesses the corresponding variable. For example, <code>x := &amp;y</code> takes a reference to <em>y</em> and assigns it to <em>x</em>, then <code>%x% := 1</code> assigns to the variable <em>y</em> and <code>%x%</code> reads its value.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the value of the sub-expression <em>Expr</em> is used as the name or partial name of a variable or property. This allows the script to refer to a variable or property whose name is determined by evaluating <em>Expr</em>, which is typically another variable. Variables cannot be created dynamically, but a variable can be assigned dynamically if it has been declared or referenced non-dynamically somewhere in the script.</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <u>result</u> of the sub-expression <em>Expr</em> must be the name or partial name of the variable or property to be accessed.</p>
      <p>Percent signs cannot be used directly within <em>Expr</em> due to ambiguity, but can be nested within parentheses. Otherwise, <em>Expr</em> can be any expression.</p>
      <p>If there are any adjoining <em>%Expr%</em> sequences and partial <a href="Concepts.htm#names">names</a> (without any spaces or other characters between them), they are combined to form a single name.</p>
      <p>An <a href="lib/Error.htm">Error</a> is typically thrown if the variable does not already exist, or if it is uninitialized and its value is being read. The <a href="#or-maybe">or-maybe operator (??)</a> can be used to avoid that case by providing a default value. For example: <code>%'novar'% ?? 42</code>.</p>
      <p>Although this is historically known as a "double-deref", this term is inaccurate when <em>Expr</em> does not contain a variable (first deref), and also when the resulting variable is the target of an assignment, not being dereferenced (second deref).</p>

      <p><strong>Pre- and post-increment/decrement</strong>. Adds or subtracts 1 from a variable. The operator may appear either before or after the variable's name. If it appears <em>before</em> the name, the operation is performed and its result is used by the next operation (the result is a variable reference in this case). For example, <code>Var := ++X</code> increments X and then assigns its value to <em>Var</em>. Conversely, if the operator appears <em>after</em> the variable's name, the result is the value of X prior to performing the operation. For example, <code>Var := X++</code> increments X but <em>Var</em> receives the value X had before it was incremented.</p>
      <p>These operators can also be used with a property of an object, such as <code>myArray.Length++</code> or <code>--myArray[i]</code>. In these cases, the result of the sub-expression is always a number, not a variable reference.</p>

Since ** is of higher precedence than unary minus, <code>-2**2</code> is evaluated like <code>-(2**2)</code> and so yields -4.

For example: <code>!x or !(y and z)</code>. Note: The word NOT is synonymous with <strong>!</strong> except that <strong>!</strong> has a higher precedence. Consecutive unary operators such as <code><strong>!!</strong>Var</code> are allowed because they are evaluated in right-to-left order.</p>
      <p><strong>Bitwise-not (~)</strong>: This inverts each bit of its operand. As 64-bit signed integers are used, a positive input value will always give a negative result and vice versa. For example, <code>~0xf0f</code> evaluates to -0xf10 (-3856), which is binary equivalent to 0xfffffffffffff0f0. If an unsigned 32-bit value is intended, the result can be truncated with <code><i>result</i> &amp; 0xffffffff</code>.

    <td><p><strong>Assign</strong>. Performs an operation on the contents of a variable and stores the result back in the same variable. The simplest assignment operator is colon-equals (:=), which stores the result of an expression in a variable. For a description of what the other operators do, see their related entries in this table. For example, <code>Var //= 2</code> performs <a href="#IntegerDivide">integer division</a> to divide <em>Var</em> by 2, then stores the result back in <em>Var</em>. Similarly, <code>Var <strong>.=</strong> "abc"</code> is a shorthand way of writing <code>Var := Var <strong>.</strong> "abc"</code>.</p>
      <p>Unlike most other operators, assignments are evaluated from right to left. Consequently, a line such as <code>Var1 := Var2 := 0</code> first assigns 0 to <em>Var2</em> then assigns <em>Var2</em> to <em>Var1</em>.</p>
    <p>If an assignment is used as the input for some other operator, its value is the variable itself. For example,  the expression <code>(Var+=2) &gt; 50</code> is true if the newly-increased value in <em>Var</em> is greater than 50. It is also valid to combine an assignment with the <a href="#ref">reference operator</a>, as in <code>&amp;(Var := "initial value")</code>.</p>
    <p>The precedence of the assignment operators is automatically raised when it would avoid a syntax error or provide more intuitive behavior. For example: <code>not x:=y</code> is evaluated as <code>not (x:=y)</code>. Similarly, <code>++Var := X</code> is evaluated as <code>++(Var := X)</code>; and <code>Z&gt;0 ? X:=2 : Y:=2</code> is evaluated as <code>Z&gt;0 ? (X:=2) : (Y:=2)</code>.</p>
    <p>The target variable can be <em>un-set</em> by combining a direct assignment (<code>:=</code>) with the <code>unset</code> keyword or the <a href="#maybe">maybe (<em>var</em>?)</a> operator. For example: <code>Var := unset</code>, <code>Var1 := (Var2?)</code>.</p>
    <p>An assignment can also target a property of an object, such as <code>myArray.Length += n</code> or <code>myArray[i] .= t</code>. When assigning to a property, the result of the sub-expression is the value being assigned, not a variable reference.</p>

      <p><strong>Fat arrow function</strong>. Defines a simple <a href="Functions.htm">function</a> and returns a <a href="lib/Func.htm">Func</a> or <a href="Functions.htm#closures">Closure</a> object. Write the function's <a href="Functions.htm#param">parameter list</a> (optionally preceded by a function name) to the left of the operator. When the function is called (via the returned reference), it evaluates the sub-expression <em>expr</em> and returns the result.</p>
      <p>The following two examples are equivalent:</p>
      <pre>sumfn := Sum(a, b) =&gt; a + b</pre>
      <pre>Sum(a, b) {
    return a + b
}
sumfn := Sum</pre>
      <p>In both cases, the function is defined <strong>unconditionally</strong> at the moment the script launches, but the function reference is stored in <em>sumfn</em> only if and when the assignment is evaluated.</p>
      <p>If the function name is omitted and the parameter list consists of only a single parameter name, the parentheses can be omitted. The example below defines an anonymous function with one parameter <code>a</code> and stores its reference in the variable <code>double</code>:</p>
      <pre>double := a =&gt; a * 2</pre>
      <p>Variable references in <em>expr</em> are resolved in the same way as in the equivalent full function definition. For instance, <em>expr</em> may refer to an outer function's local variables (as in any <a href="Functions.htm#nested">nested function</a>), in which case a new <a href="Functions.htm#closures">closure</a> is created and returned each time the fat arrow expression is evaluated. The function is always <a href="Functions.htm#AssumeLocal">assume-local</a>, since declarations cannot be used.</p>
      <p>Specifying a name for the function allows it to be called recursively or by other nested functions without storing a reference to the <a href="Functions.htm#closures">closure</a> within itself (thereby creating a problematic <a href="Objects.htm#Circular_References">circular reference</a>). It can also be helpful for debugging, such with <a href="lib/Func.htm#Name">Func.Name</a> or when displayed on the debugger's call stack.</p>
      <p>Fat arrow syntax can also be used to define shorthand <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_property_short">properties</a> and <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_method">methods</a>.</p>

      <p>Comma is also used to delimit the parameters of a function call or control flow statement. To include a multi-statement expression in a parameter list, enclose it in an extra set of parentheses.

  <li>When a variable is given a new string longer than its current contents, additional system memory is allocated automatically.</li>
  <li>The memory occupied by a large variable can be freed by setting it equal to nothing, e.g. <code>var := ""</code>.</li>
  <li>There is no limit to how many variables a script may create. The program is designed to support at least several million variables without a significant drop in performance.</li>
  <li>Functions and expressions that accept numeric inputs generally support 15 digits of precision for floating point values. For integers, 64-bit signed values are supported, which range from -9223372036854775808 (-0x8000000000000000) to 9223372036854775807 (0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF). Any integer constants outside this range wrap around. Similarly, arithmetic operations on integers wrap around upon overflow (e.g. 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF + 1 = -0x8000000000000000).</li>

<h1>How to Install AutoHotkey</h1>

<p>If you have not already downloaded AutoHotkey, you can get it from one of the following locations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">https://www.autohotkey.com/</a> - multiple options are presented when you click Download.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/download/">https://www.autohotkey.com/download/</a> - the main download links are for the current exe installer, but there are also links to the current zip package and archive of older versions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This tutorial is for AutoHotkey v2.</p>
<p>The main download has a filename like <code>AutoHotkey_2.0_setup.exe</code>. Run this file to begin installing AutoHotkey.</p>
<p>If you are not the administrator of your computer, you may need to select the <em>Current user</em> option.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the recommended options are already filled in, so just click <strong>Install</strong>.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>For users of v1</strong>: AutoHotkey v2 includes a launcher which allows multiple versions of AutoHotkey to co-exist while sharing one file extension (<code>.ahk</code>). Installing AutoHotkey v1 and v2 into different directories is not necessary and is currently not supported.</p>
<p>If you are installing for <em>all users</em>, you will need to provide administrator consent in the standard UAC prompt that appears (in other words, click <em>Yes</em>).</p>
<p>If there were no complications, AutoHotkey is now installed!</p>
<p class="note">Once installation completes, the <a href="../Program.htm#dash">Dash</a> is shown automatically.</p>

<h2 id="Next_Steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p><a href="../Program.htm">Using the Program</a> covers the basics of how to use AutoHotkey.</p>

<h1>How to Manage Windows</h1>
<p>One of the easiest and most useful things AutoHotkey can do is allow you to create keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) that manipulate windows. A script can activate, close, minimize, maximize, restore, hide, show or move almost any window. This is done by calling the appropriate <a href="../lib/Win.htm">Win function</a>, specifying the window by title or some other criteria:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad.exe"
WinWait "Untitled - Notepad"
WinActivate "Untitled - Notepad"
WinMove 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth/4, A_ScreenHeight/2, "Untitled - Notepad"</pre>
<p>This example should open a new Notepad window and then move it to fill a portion of the primary screen (&frac14; of its width and &frac12; its height). To learn how to try it out, refer to <a href="RunExamples.htm">How to Run Example Code</a>.</p>

<p>We won't go into detail about many of the functions for manipulating windows, since there's not much to it. For instance, to minimize a window instead of activating it, replace <code>WinActivate</code> with <code>WinMinimize</code>. See <a href="../lib/Win.htm">Win functions</a> for a list of functions which can manipulate windows or retrieve information.</p>
<p>Most of this tutorial is about ways to <em>identify</em> which window you want to operate on, since that is often the most troublesome part. For instance, there are a number of problems with the example above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The title is repeated unnecessarily.</li>
  <li>The title is correct only for systems with UI language set to English.</li>
  <li>It might move an existing untitled Notepad window instead of the new one.</li>
  <li>If for some reason no matching window appears, the script will stall indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll address these issues one at a time, after covering a few basics.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong> AutoHotkey comes with a script called <em>Window Spy</em>, which can be used to confirm the title, class and process name of a window. The class and process name are often used when identifying a window by title alone is not feasible. You can find Window Spy in the script's <a href="../Program.htm#tray-icon">tray menu</a> or the <a href="../Program.htm#dash">AutoHotkey Dash</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ttm">Title Matching</h2>
<p>There are a few things to know when specifying a window by title:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Window titles are always case-sensitive, except when using the RegEx matching mode with the <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm#opt_i">i) modifier</a>.</li>
  <li>By default, functions expect a substring of the window title. For example, "Notepad" could match both "Untitled - Notepad" and "C:\A\B.ahk - Notepad++". <a href="../lib/SetTitleMatchMode.htm">SetTitleMatchMode</a> can be used to make functions expect a prefix, exact match, or RegEx pattern instead.</li>
  <li>By default, hidden windows are ignored (except by <a href="../lib/WinShow.htm">WinShow</a>). <a href="../lib/DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> can be used to change this.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#Matching">Matching Behaviour</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="A">Active Window</h2>
<p>To refer to the active window, use the letter "A" in place of a window title. For example, this minimizes the active window:</p>
<pre>WinMinimize "A"</pre>

<h2 id="lfw">Last Found Window</h2>
<p>When <a href="../lib/WinWait.htm">WinWait</a>, <a href="../lib/WinExist.htm">WinExist</a>, <a href="../lib/WinActive.htm">WinActive</a>, <a href="../lib/WinWaitActive.htm">WinWaitActive</a> or <a href="../lib/WinWaitActive.htm">WinWaitNotActive</a> find a matching window, they set it as the <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow"><em>last found window</em></a>. Most window functions allow the window title (and related parameters) to be omitted, and will in that case default to the last found window. For example:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad.exe"
WinWait "Untitled - Notepad"
WinActivate
WinMove 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth/4, A_ScreenHeight/2</pre>
<p>This saves repeating the window title, which saves a little of your time, makes the script easier to update if the window title needs to be changed, and might make the code easier to read. It makes the script more reliable by ensuring that it operates on the same window each time, even when there are multiple matching windows, or if the window title changes after the window is "found". It also makes the script execute more efficiently, but not by much.</p>

<h2 id="class">Window Class</h2>
<p>A window class is a set of attributes that is used as a template to create a window.  Often the name of a window's class is related to the app or the purpose of the window. A window's class never changes while the window exists, so we can often use it to identify a window when identifying by title is impractical or impossible.</p>
<p>For example, instead of the window title "Untitled - Notepad", we can use the window's class, which in this case happens to be "Notepad" <em>regardless</em> of the system language:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad.exe"
WinWait "ahk_class Notepad"
WinActivate
WinMove 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth/4, A_ScreenHeight/2</pre>
<p>A window class is distinguished from a title by using the word "ahk_class" as shown above. To combine multiple criteria, list the window title first. For example: "Untitled ahk_class Notepad".</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_class">ahk_class</a></p>

<h2 id="exe">Process Name/Path</h2>
<p>Windows can be identified by the process which created them by using the word "ahk_exe" followed by the name or path of the process. For example:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad.exe"
WinWait "ahk_exe notepad.exe"
WinActivate
WinMove 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth/4, A_ScreenHeight/2</pre>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_exe">ahk_exe</a></p>

<h2 id="pid">Process ID (PID)</h2>
<p>Each process has an ID number which remains unique until the process exits. We can use this to make our Notepad example more reliable by ensuring that it ignores any Notepad window except the one that is created by the new process:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad.exe",,, &amp;notepad_pid
WinWait "ahk_pid " notepad_pid
WinActivate
WinMove 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth/4, A_ScreenHeight/2</pre>
<p>We need three commas in a row; two of them are just to skip the unused <em>WorkingDir</em> and <em>Options</em> parameters of the Run function, since the one we want (<em>OutputVarPID</em>) is the fourth parameter.</p>
<p>Ampersand (&amp;) is the <a href="../Variables.htm#ref">reference operator</a>. This is used to pass the <code>notepad_pid</code> variable to the Run function <em>by reference</em> (in other words, to pass the variable itself instead of its value), allowing the function to assign a new value to the variable. Then <code>notepad_pid</code> becomes a placeholder for the actual process ID.</p>
<p>The <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">string</a> "ahk_pid " is <a href="../Variables.htm#concat">concatenated</a> with the process ID contained by the notepad_pid variable by simply writing them in sequence, separated by whitespace. The result is a string like "ahk_pid 1040", but the number isn't predictable.</p>
<p>If the new process might create multiple windows, a window title and other criteria can be combined by delimiting them with spaces. The window title must always come first. For example: <code>"Untitled ahk_class Notepad ahk_pid " notepad_pid</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_pid">ahk_pid</a></p>

<h2 id="hwnd">Window ID (HWND)</h2>
<p>Each window has an ID number which remains unique until the window is destroyed. In programming parlance, this is known as a "window handle" or HWND. Although not as convenient as using the <em>last found window</em>, the window's ID can be stored in a variable so that the script can refer to it by a name of your choice, even if the title changes. There can be only one <em>last found window</em> at a time, but you can use as many window IDs as you can make up variable names for (or you can use an <a href="../lib/Array.htm">array</a>).</p>
<p>A window ID is <a href="../Concepts.htm#return-a-value">returned</a> by <a href="../lib/WinWait.htm">WinWait</a>, <a href="../lib/WinExist.htm">WinExist</a> or <a href="../lib/WinActive.htm">WinActive</a>, or can come from some other sources. The Notepad example can be rewritten to take advantage of this:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad.exe"
notepad_id := WinWait("Untitled - Notepad")
WinActivate notepad_id
WinMove 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth/4, A_ScreenHeight/2, notepad_id</pre>
<p>This assigns the return value of WinWait to the variable "notepad_id". In other words, when WinWait finds the window, it produces the window's ID as its result, and the script then stores this result in the variable. "notepad_id" is just a name that I've made up for this example; you can use whatever variable names make sense to you (within <a href="../Concepts.htm#names">certain constraints</a>).</p>
<p>Notice that I added parentheses around the window title, <em>immediately</em> following the function name. Parentheses can be omitted in <a href="../Language.htm#function-call-statements">function call statements</a> (that is, function calls at the very beginning of the line), but in that case you cannot get the function's return value.</p>
<p>The script can also retain the <a href="../Concepts.htm#variables">variable</a> <code>notepad_id</code> for later use, such as to close or reactivate the window or move it somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_id">ahk_id</a></p>

<h2 id="timeout">Timeout</h2>
<p>By default, WinWait will wait indefinitely for a matching window to appear. You can determine whether this has happened by opening the script's <a href="../Program.htm#main-window">main window</a> via the <a href="../Program.htm#tray-icon">tray icon</a> (unless you've <a href="../lib/_NoTrayIcon.htm">disabled it</a>). The window normally opens on <a href="../lib/ListLines.htm#Remarks">ListLines</a> view by default. If WinWait is still waiting, it will appear at the very bottom of the list of lines, followed by the number of seconds since it began waiting. The number doesn't update unless you select "Refresh" from the View menu.</p>
<p>Try running this example and opening the main window as described above:</p>
<pre>WinWait "Untitled - Notpad"  <em>; (intentional typo)</em></pre>
<p>If the script is stuck waiting for a window, you will usually need to exit or reload the script to get it unstuck. To prevent that from happening in the first place (or happening again), you can use the <em>Timeout</em> parameter of WinWait. For example, this will wait at most 5 seconds for the window to appear:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad.exe",,, &amp;notepad_pid
if WinWait("ahk_pid " notepad_pid,, 5)
{
    WinActivate
    WinMove 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth/4, A_ScreenHeight/2
}</pre>
<p>The <a href="../lib/Block.htm">block</a> below the if statement is executed only if WinWait finds a matching window. If it times out, the block is skipped and execution continues after the closing brace (if there is any code after it).</p>
<p>Note that the parentheses after "WinWait" are required when we want to use the function's result in an <a href="../Language.htm#expressions">expression</a> (such as the condition of an <a href="../lib/If.htm">if statement</a>). You can think of the <a href="../Language.htm#function-calls">function call</a> itself as a substitute for the result of the function. For instance, if WinWait finds a match before timing out, the result is non-zero. <code>if 1</code> would execute the block below the if statement, whereas <code>if 0</code> would skip it.</p>
<p>Another way to write it is to return early (in other words, abort) if the wait times out. For example:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad.exe",,, &amp;notepad_pid
if !WinWait("ahk_pid " notepad_pid,, 5)
    return
WinActivate
WinMove 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth/4, A_ScreenHeight/2</pre>
<p>The result is inverted by applying the <a href="../Variables.htm#unary">logical-not</a> operator (<code>!</code> or <code>not</code>). If WinWait times out, its result is 0. The result of <code>!0</code> is 1, so when WinWait times out, the if statement executes the <code>return</code>.</p>
<p>WinWait's result is actually the ID of the window (as described above) or zero if it timed out. If you also want to refer to the window by ID, you can assign the result to a variable instead of using it directly in the if statement:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad.exe",,, &amp;notepad_pid
notepad_id := WinWait("ahk_pid " notepad_pid,, 5)
if notepad_id
{
    WinActivate notepad_id
    WinMove 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth/4, A_ScreenHeight/2, notepad_id
}</pre>
<p>To avoid repeating the variable name, you can both assign the result to a variable and check that it is non-zero (<a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean"><em>true</em></a>) at the same time:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad.exe",,, &amp;notepad_pid
if notepad_id := WinWait("ahk_pid " notepad_pid,, 2)
{
    WinActivate notepad_id
    WinMove 0, 0, A_ScreenWidth/4, A_ScreenHeight/2, notepad_id
}</pre>
<p>In that case, be careful not to confuse <code>:=</code> (assignment) with <code>=</code> or <code>==</code> (comparison). For example, <code>if myvar := 0</code> assigns a new value and gives the same result every time (false), whereas <code>if myvar = 0</code> compares a previously-assigned value with 0.</p>

<h2 id="math">Expressions (Math etc.)</h2>
<p>When you want to move a window, it is often useful to move or size it relative to its previous position or size, which can be retrieved by using the <a href="../lib/WinGetPos.htm">WinGetPos</a> function. For example, the following set of hotkeys can be used to move the active window by 10 pixels in each direction, by holding <kbd>RCtrl</kbd> and pressing the arrow keys:</p>
<pre>&gt;^Left::    MoveActiveWindowBy(-10,   0)
&gt;^Right::   MoveActiveWindowBy(+10,   0)
&gt;^Up::      MoveActiveWindowBy(  0, -10)
&gt;^Down::    MoveActiveWindowBy(  0, +10)

MoveActiveWindowBy(x, y) {
    WinExist "A"  <em>; Make the active window the Last Found Window  </em>
    WinGetPos &amp;current_x, &amp;current_y
    WinMove current_x + x, current_y + y
}</pre>
<p>The example <a href="../Functions.htm#intro">defines a function</a> to avoid repeating code several times. <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> become placeholders for the two numbers specified in each hotkey. WinGetPos stores the current position in <code>current_x</code> and <code>current_y</code>, which we then add to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>Simple expressions such as this should look fairly familiar. For more details, see <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">Expressions</a>; but be aware there is a lot of detail that you probably won't need to learn immediately.</p>

<link href="../static/theme.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<script src="../static/content.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>
<body>
<h1>How to Run Example Code</h1>
<p>The easiest way to get started quickly with AutoHotkey is to take example code, try it out and adapt it to your needs.</p>
<p>Within this documentation, there are many examples in code blocks such as the one below.</p>
<pre>MsgBox "Hello, world!"</pre>
<p>Most (but not all) examples can be executed as-is to demonstrate their effect. There are generally two ways to do this:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li><b>Download the code as a file.</b> If your browser supports it, you can download any code block (such as the one above) as a script file by clicking the <span style="font-family: icons;">↓</span> button which appears in the top-right of the code block when you hover your mouse over it.</li>
  <li><b>Copy the code into a file.</b> It's usually best to <a href="../Program.htm#create">create a new file</a>, so existing code won't interfere with the example code. Once the file has been created, <a href="../Program.htm#edit">open it for editing</a> and copy-paste the code.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Run the file:</b> Once you have the code in a script (.ahk) file, running it is usually just a case of double-clicking the file; but there are <a href="../Program.htm#run">other methods</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hotkeys">Assigning Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Sometimes testing code is easier if you assign it to a hotkey first. For example, consider this code for maximizing the active window:</p>
<pre>WinMaximize "A"</pre>
<p>If you save this into a file and run the file by double-clicking it, it will likely maximize the File Explorer window which contains the file. You can instead assign it to a hotkey to test its effect on whatever window you want. For example:</p>
<pre>^1::WinMaximize "A"</pre>
<p>Now you can activate your <em>test subject</em> and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> to maximize it.</p>
<p>For more about hotkeys, see <a href="WriteHotkeys.htm">How to Write Hotkeys</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bailing-out">Bailing Out</h2>
<p>If you make a mistake in a script, sometimes it can make the computer harder to use. For example, the hotkey <code>n::</code> would activate whenever you press <kbd>N</kbd> and would prevent you from typing that character. To undo this, all you need to do is exit the script. You can do that by right clicking on the script's <a href="../Program.htm#tray-icon">tray icon</a> and selecting Exit.</p>
<p>Keys can get "stuck down" if you send a key-down and don't send a key-up. In that case, exiting the script won't necessarily be enough, as the operating system still thinks the key is being held down. Generally you can "unstick" the key by physically pressing it.</p>
<p>If a script gets into a runaway loop or is otherwise difficult to stop, you can log off or shut down the computer as a last resort. When you log off, all apps running under your session are terminated, including AutoHotkey. In some cases you might need to click "log off anyway" or "shut down anyway" if a script or program is preventing shutdown.</p>

<h2 id="reloading">Reloading</h2>
<p>After you've started the script, changes to the script's file do not take effect automatically. In order to make them take effect, you must reload the script. This can be done via the script's <a href="../Program.htm#tray-icon">tray icon</a> or the <a href="../lib/Reload.htm">Reload</a> function, which you can call from a hotkey. In many cases it can also be done by simply running the script again, but that depends on the script's <a href="../lib/_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a> setting.</p>

<h2 id="tools">The Right Tools</h2>
<p>Learning to code is often a repetitious process; take some code, make a small change, test the code, rinse and repeat. This process is quicker and more productive if you use a <a href="../misc/Editors.htm">text editor with support for AutoHotkey</a>. Support varies between editors, but the most important features are (in my opinion):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to run the script with a keyboard shortcut (such as F5).</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting to make the code easier to read (and write).</li>
</ul>

<h1>How to Run Programs</h1>
<p>One of the easiest and most useful things AutoHotkey can do is allow you to create keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) that launch programs.</p>
<p>Programs are launched by calling the <a href="../lib/Run.htm">Run</a> function, <a href="../Concepts.htm#pass-parameters">passing</a> the command line of the program as a <a href="../Concepts.htm#parameters">parameter</a>:</p>
<pre>Run "C:\Windows\notepad.exe"</pre>
<p>This example launches Notepad. To learn how to try it out, refer to <a href="RunExamples.htm">How to Run Example Code</a>.</p>
<p>At this stage, we haven't defined a hotkey (in other words, assigned a keyboard shortcut), so the instructions are carried out immediately. In this case, the script has nothing else to do, so it automatically exits. If you prefer to make useful hotkeys while learning, check out <a href="WriteHotkeys.htm">How to Write Hotkeys</a> first.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Run can also be used to open documents, folders and URLs.</p>
<p>To launch other programs, simply replace the path in the example above with the path of the program you wish to launch. Some programs have their paths registered with the system, in which case you can get away with just passing the filename of the program, with or (sometimes) without the ".exe" extension. For example:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad"</pre>

<h2 id="Command-line_Parameters">Command-line Parameters</h2>
<p>If the program accepts command-line parameters, they can be passed as part of the <a href="../lib/Run.htm">Run</a> function's first parameter. The following example should open license.txt in Notepad:</p>
<pre>
Run "notepad C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\license.txt"
</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This example assumes AutoHotkey is installed in the default location, and will show an error otherwise.</p>
<p>Simple, right? Now suppose that we want to open the file in WordPad instead of Notepad.</p>
<pre>Run "wordpad C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\license.txt"</pre>
<p>Run this code and see what you can learn from the result.</p>
<p>Okay, so the new code doesn't work. Hopefully you didn't dismiss the error dialog immediately; error dialogs are a normal part of the process of coding, and often contain very useful information. This one should tell us a few things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Firstly, the obvious: the program couldn't be launched.</li>
  <li>The dialog shows "Action" and "Params", but our whole command line is shown next to "Action", and "Params" is empty. In other words, the Run function doesn't know where the program name ends and the parameters begin.</li>
  <li>"The system cannot find the file specified" (on English-language systems). Perhaps the system couldn't find "wordpad", but what it's really saying is that there is no such file as "wordpad C:\...".</li>
</ul>
<p>But why did Notepad work? Running either "notepad" or "wordpad" on its own works, but for different reasons. Unlike notepad.exe, wordpad.exe cannot be found by checking each directory listed in the PATH environment variable. It can be located by a different method, which requires the Run function to separate the program name and parameters.</p>
<p>So in this case, the Run function needs a bit of help, in any or all of the following forms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explicitly use the ".exe" extension.</li>
  <li>Explicitly use the full path of wordpad.exe.</li>
  <li>Enclose the program name in quotation marks.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, go with the easiest option:</p>
<pre>Run "wordpad.exe C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\license.txt"</pre>
<p>Now WordPad launches, but it shows an error: "C:\Program" wasn't found.</p>

<h2 id="Quote_Marks_and_Spaces">Quote Marks and Spaces</h2>
<p>Often when passing command-line parameters to a program, it is necessary to enclose each parameter in quote marks if the parameter contains a space. This wasn't necessary with Notepad, but Notepad is an exception to the general rule. A naive attempt at a solution might be to simply add more quote marks:</p>
<pre>Run "wordpad.exe "C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\license.txt""</pre>
<p>But this won't work, because by default, quote marks are used to denote the start and end of literal text. So how do we include a literal quote mark within the command line, rather than having it end the command line?</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Precede each literal quote mark with <code>`</code> (back-tick, back-quote or grave accent). This is known as an <a href="../misc/EscapeChar.htm">escape sequence</a>. The quote mark is then included in the command line (i.e. the string that is passed to the Run function), whereas the back-tick, having fulfilled its purpose, is left out.</p>
<pre>Run "wordpad.exe `"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\license.txt`""</pre>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Enclose the command line in single quotes instead of double quotes.</p>
<pre>Run 'wordpad.exe "C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\license.txt"'</pre>
<p>Of course, in that case any <em>literal</em> single quotes (or apostrophes) in the text would need to be escaped (<code>`'</code>).</p>
<p>How you write the code affects which quote marks actually make it through to the Run function. In the two examples above, the Run function receives the string <code>wordpad.exe "C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\license.txt"</code>. The Run function either splits this into a <em>program name</em> and <em>parameters</em> (everything else) or leaves that up to the system. In either case, how the remaining quote marks are interpreted depends entirely on the target program.</p>
<p>Many programs treat a quote mark as part of the parameter if it is preceded by a backslash. For example, <code>Run 'my.exe "A\" B'</code> might produce a parameter with the value <code>A" B</code> instead of two parameters. This is up to the program, and can usually be avoided by doubling the backslash, as in <code>Run 'my.exe "A\\" B'</code>, which usually produces two parameters (<code>A\</code> and <code>B</code>).</p>
<p>Most programs interpret quote marks as a sort of toggle, switching modes between "space ends the parameter" and "space is included in the parameter". In other words, <code>Run 'my.exe "A B"'</code> is generally equivalent to <code>Run 'my.exe A" "B'</code>. So another way to avoid issues with slashes is to quote the <em>spaces</em> instead of the entire parameter, or end the quote before the slash, as in <code>Run 'my.exe "A"\ B'</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Including_Variables">Including Variables</h2>
<p>Often a command line needs to include some <a href="../Concepts.htm#variables">variables</a>. For example, the location of the "Program Files" directory can vary between systems, and a script can take this into account by using the <a href="../Variables.htm#ProgramFiles">A_ProgramFiles</a> variable. If the variable contains the entire command line, simply pass the variable to the Run function to execute it.</p>
<pre>Run A_ComSpec  <em>; Start a command prompt (almost always cmd.exe).</em>
Run A_MyDocuments  <em>; Open the user's Documents folder.</em></pre>
<p>Including a variable <em>inside</em> a quoted string won't work; instead, we use <a href="../Variables.htm#concat">concatenation</a> to join literal strings together with variables. For example:</p>
<pre>Run 'notepad.exe "' A_MyDocuments '\AutoHotkey.ahk"'</pre>
<p>Another method is to use <a href="../lib/Format.htm">Format</a> to perform substitution. For example:</p>
<pre>Run Format('notepad.exe "{1}\AutoHotkey.ahk"', A_MyDocuments)</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Format can perform additional formatting at the same time, such as padding with 0s or spaces, or formatting numbers as hexadecimal instead of decimal.</p>

<h2 id="Runs_Parameters">Run's Parameters</h2>
<p>Aside from the command line to execute, the Run function accepts a few other <a href="../Concepts.htm#parameters">parameters</a> that affect its behaviour.</p>
<p><em>WorkingDir</em> specifies the working directory for the new process. If you specify a relative path for the program, it is relative to this directory. Relative paths in command line parameters are often also relative to this directory, but that depends on the program.</p>
<pre>Run "cmd", "C:\"  <em>; Open a command prompt at C:\</em></pre>
<p><em>Options</em> can often be used to run a program minimized or hidden, instead of having it pop up on screen, but some programs ignore it.</p>
<p><em>OutputVarPID</em> gives you the process ID, which is often used with <a href="../lib/WinWait.htm">WinWait</a> or <a href="../lib/WinWaitActive.htm">WinWaitActive</a> and <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_pid">ahk_pid</a> to wait until the program shows a window on screen, or to identify one of its windows. For example:</p>
<pre>Run "notepad",,, &amp;pid
WinWaitActive "ahk_pid " pid
SendText "Hello, world!"</pre>

<h2 id="System_Verbs">System Verbs</h2>
<p><a href="../lib/Run.htm#verbs">System verbs</a> are actions that the system or applications register for specific file types. They are normally available in the file's right-click menu in Explorer, but their actual names don't always match the text displayed in the menu. For example, AutoHotkey scripts have an "edit" verb which opens the script in an editor, and (if Ahk2Exe is installed) a "compile" verb which <a href="../Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">compiles</a> the script.</p>
<p>"Edit" is one of a list of common verbs that Run recognizes by default, so can be used by just writing the word followed by a space and the filename, as follows:</p>
<pre>Run 'edit ' A_ScriptFullPath  <em>; Generally equivalent to <a href="../lib/Edit.htm">Edit</a></em></pre>
<p>Any verb registered with the system can be executed by using the * prefix as shown below:</p>
<pre>Run '*Compile-Gui ' A_ScriptFullPath</pre>
<p>If Ahk2Exe is installed, this opens the Ahk2Exe Gui with the current script pre-selected.</p>

<h2 id="Environment">Environment</h2>
<p>Whenever a new process starts, it generally inherits the <em>environment</em> of the process which launched it (the <em>parent process</em>). This basically means that all of the script's <a href="../Concepts.htm#environment-variables">environment variables</a> are inherited by any program that you launch with <a href="../lib/Run.htm">Run</a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, environment variables can be set with <a href="../lib/EnvSet.htm">EnvSet</a> before launching the program to affect its behaviour, or pass information to it. A script can also use <a href="../lib/EnvGet.htm">EnvGet</a> to read environment variables that it might have inherited from its parent process.</p>
<p>On 64-bit systems, the script's own environment heavily depends on whether the EXE running it is 32-bit or 64-bit. 32-bit processes not only have different environment variables, but also have <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winprog64/file-system-redirector">file system redirection</a> in place for compatibility reasons.</p>
<pre>Run "cmd /k set pro"</pre>
<p>The example above shows a command prompt which prints all environment variables beginning with "pro". If you run it from a 32-bit script, you will likely see <code>PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE=x86</code> and <code>ProgramFiles=C:\Program Files (x86)</code>. Although the title shows something like "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe", this is a lie; it is actually the 32-bit version, which really resides in "C:\Windows\SysWow64\cmd.exe".</p>
<p>In simple cases like this, the easiest way to bypass the redirection of "System32" is to use "SysNative" instead. However, this only works from a 32-bit process on a 64-bit system, so must be done conditionally. When the following example is executed on a 64-bit system, it shows a 64-bit command prompt even if the script is 32-bit:</p>
<pre>if FileExist(A_WinDir "\SysNative")
    Run A_WinDir "\SysNative\cmd.exe /k set pro"
else
    Run "cmd /k set pro"</pre>

<h1>How to Send Keystrokes</h1>
<pre>Send "Hello, world{!}{Left}^+{Left}"</pre>
<p>Sending keystrokes (or keys for short) is the most common method of automating programs, because it is the one that works most generally. More direct methods tend to work only in particular types of app.</p>
<p>There are broadly two parts to learning how to send keys:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How to write the code so that the program knows which keys you want to send.</li>
  <li>How to use the available modes and options to get the right end result.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to understand that sending a key does not perfectly replicate the act of physically pressing the key, even if you slow it down to human speeds. But before we go into that, we'll cover some basics.</p>

<h2 id="Trying_the_examples">Trying the examples</h2>
<p>If you run an example like <code>SendText "Hi!"</code>, the text will be immediately sent to the active (focused) window, which might be less than useful depending on how you ran the example. It's usually better to define a hotkey, run the example to load it up, and press the hotkey when you want to test its effect. Some of the examples below will use numbered hotkeys like <code>^1::</code> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and a number, so you can try multiple examples at once if there are no duplicates), but you can change that to whatever suits you.</p>
<p>To learn how to customize the hotkeys or create your own, see <a href="WriteHotkeys.htm">How to Write Hotkeys</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not sure how to try out the examples, see <a href="RunExamples.htm">How to Run Example Code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="How_to_write_the_code">How to write the code</h2>
<p>When sending keys, you generally want to either send a key or key combination for its effect (like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy to the clipboard), or type some text. Typing text is simpler, so we'll start there: just call the <a href="../lib/Send.htm">SendText</a> function, <a href="../Concepts.htm#pass-parameters">passing</a> it the exact text you want to send.</p>
<pre>^1::SendText "To Whom It May Concern"</pre>
<p>Technically SendText actually sends Unicode character packets and not keystrokes, and that makes it much more reliable for characters that are normally typed with a key-combination like <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> or <kbd>AltGr</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>.</p>

<h3 id="Rules_of_quoted_strings">Rules of quoted strings</h3>
<p>SendText sends the text verbatim, but keep in mind the rules of the <a href="../Language.htm">language</a>. For instance, <a href="../Language.htm#strings">literal text</a> must be enclosed in quote marks (double <code>"</code> or single <code>'</code>), and the quote marks themselves aren't "seen" by the SendText function. To send a literal quote mark, you can enclose it in the opposite type of quote mark. For example:</p>
<pre>^2::SendText 'Quote marks are also known as "quotes".'</pre>
<p>Alternatively, use an <a href="../misc/EscapeChar.htm">escape sequence</a>. Inside a quoted string, <code>`"</code> translates to a literal <code>"</code> and <code>`'</code> translates to a literal <code>'</code>. For example:</p>
<pre>^3::{
    SendText "Double quote (`")"
    SendText 'Single quote (`')'
}</pre>
<p>You can also alternate the quote marks:</p>
<pre>^4::SendText 'Double (") and' . " single (') quote"</pre>
<p>The two strings are joined together (<a href="../Variables.htm#concat">concatenated</a>) before being passed to the SendText function. The dot (<code>.</code>) can be omitted, but that makes it harder to see where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p>As you've seen above, the escape character <code>`</code> (known by <em>backquote</em>, <em>backtick</em>, <em>grave accent</em> and other names) has special meaning, so if you want to send that character literally (or send the corresponding key), you need to double it up, as in <code>Send "``"</code>. Other common escape sequences include <code>`n</code> for linefeed (Enter) and <code>`t</code> for tab. See <a href="../misc/EscapeChar.htm">Escape Sequences</a> for more.</p>

<h3 id="Sending_keys_and_key_combinations">Sending keys and key combinations</h3>
<p><a href="../lib/Send.htm">SendText</a> is best for sending text verbatim, but it can't send keys that don't produce text, like <kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Home</kbd>. <a href="../lib/Send.htm">Send</a>, <a href="../lib/Send.htm">SendInput</a>, <a href="../lib/Send.htm">SendPlay</a>, <a href="../lib/Send.htm">SendEvent</a> and <a href="../lib/ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a> can send both text and key combinations, or keys which don't produce text. To do all of this, they add special meaning to the following symbols: <code>^!+#{}</code></p>
<p>The first four symbols correspond to the standard modifier keys, Ctrl (<code>^</code>), Alt (<code>!</code>), Shift (<code>+</code>) and Win (<code>#</code>). They can be used in combination, but otherwise affect only the next key.</p>
<p>To send a key by name, or to send any one of the above symbols literally, enclose it in braces. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>^+{Left}</code> produces <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Left</kbd></li>
  <li><code>^{+}{Left}</code> produces <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd> followed by <kbd>Left</kbd></li>
  <li><code>^+Left</code> produces <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> followed literally by the letters <code>eft</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>"</kbd>, the following example sends two quote marks and then moves the insertion point to the left, ready to type inside the quote marks:</p>
<!-- span works around a highlighter bug (4/12/22) -->
<pre><span class="no-highlight">^+"</span>::Send '""{Left}'</pre>
<p>For any single character other than <code>^!+#{}</code>, Send translates it to the corresponding key combination and presses and releases that combination. For example, <code>Send "aB"</code> presses and releases <kbd>A</kbd> and then presses and releases <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>. Similarly, any key name enclosed in braces is pressed and released by default. For example, <code>Send "{Ctrl}a"</code> would press and release <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, then press and release <kbd>A</kbd>; probably not what you want.</p>
<p>To only press (hold down) or release a key, enclose the key name in braces, followed by a space and then the word "down" or "up". The following example causes <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>CapsLock</kbd> to act as a toggle for <kbd>Shift</kbd>:</p>
<pre>*^CapsLock::{
    if GetKeyState("Shift")
        Send "{Shift up}"
    else
        Send "{Shift down}"
}</pre>

<h3 id="Hotkeys_vs_Send">Hotkeys vs. Send</h3>
<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Hotkeys and Send have some differences that you should be aware of.</p>
<p>Although <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> also use the symbols <code>^!+#</code> and the same key names, there are several important differences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Other hotkey modifier symbols are not supported by Send. For example, <code>&gt;^a::</code> corresponds to <kbd>RCtrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>, but to send that combination, you need to spell out the key name in full, as in <code>Send "{RCtrl down}a{RCtrl up}"</code>.</li>
  <li>Key names are never enclosed in braces within hotkeys, but must always be enclosed in braces for Send (if longer than one character).</li>
  <li>Send is case-sensitive. For example, <code>Send "^A"</code> sends the combination of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <em>upper-case</em> "a", so <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. By contrast, <code>^a::</code> and <code>^A::</code> are equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is because Send serves multiple purposes, whereas hotkeys are optimized for key combinations.</p>
<p>On a related note, <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a> are exclusively for detecting text entry, so the symbols <code>^!+#{}</code> have no special meaning within the hotstring trigger text. However, a hotstring's <em>replacement</em> text uses the same syntax as Send (except when the <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#T">T option</a> is used). Whenever you type "{" with the following hotstring active, it sends "}" and then <kbd>Left</kbd> to move the insertion point back between the braces:</p>
<pre>:*?B0:{::{}}{Left}</pre>

<h3 id="Blind_mode">Blind mode</h3>
<p>Normally, Send assumes that any modifier keys you are physically holding down should not be combined with the keys you are asking it to send. For instance, if you are holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and you call <code>Send "Hi"</code>, Send will automatically release <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> before sending "Hi" and press it back down afterward.</p>
<p>Sometimes what you want is to send some keys in combination with other modifiers that were previously pressed or sent. To do this, you can use the <code>{Blind}</code> prefix. While running the following example, try focusing a non-empty text editor or input field and pressing <kbd>1</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd> while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>:</p>
<pre>*^1::Send "{Blind}{Home}"
*^2::Send "{Blind}{End}"</pre>
<p>For more about <code>{Blind}</code>, see <a href="../lib/Send.htm#Blind">Blind mode</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Others">Others</h3>
<p>Send supports a few other special constructs, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>{U+00B5}</code> to send a Unicode character by its ordinal value (character code).</li>
  <li><code>{ASC 0181}</code> to send an Alt+Numpad sequence.</li>
  <li><code class="no-highlight">{Click <i>Options</i>}</code> to click or move the mouse.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full list, see <a href="../lib/Send.htm#keynames">Key names</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Modes_and_options">Modes and options</h2>
<p>Sending a key does not perfectly replicate the act of physically pressing the key. The operating system provides several different ways to send keys, with different caveats for each. Sometimes to get the result you want, you will need to not only try different methods but also tweak the timing.</p>
<p>The <a href="../lib/Send.htm#Send_variants">main methods</a> are SendInput, SendEvent and SendPlay. SendInput is generally the most reliable, so by default, Send is synonymous with SendInput. <a href="../lib/SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> can be used to make Send synonymous with SendEvent or SendPlay instead. The documentation describes other pros and cons of <a href="../lib/Send.htm#SendInputDetail">SendInput</a> and <a href="../lib/Send.htm#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a> at length, but I would suggest just trying SendEvent or SendPlay when you have issues with SendInput.</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> SendPlay doesn't tend to work on modern systems unless you <a href="../Program.htm#Installer_uiAccess">run with UI access</a>.</p>
<p>Another option worth trying is <a href="../lib/ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a>. This doesn't use an official method of sending keystrokes, but instead sends messages directly to the window that you specify. The main advantage is that the window usually doesn't need to be active to receive these messages. But since it bypasses the normal processing of keyboard input by the system, sometimes it doesn't work.</p>

<h3 id="Timing_and_delays">Timing and delays</h3>
<p>Sometimes you can get away with sending a flood of keystrokes faster than humanly possible, and sometimes you can't. There are generally two situations where you might need a delay:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A keypress is supposed to trigger some change within the target app (such as showing a new control or window), and sending another keypress before that happens will have the wrong effect.</li>
  <li>The app can't keep up with a rapid stream of keystrokes, and you need to slow them all down.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first case, you can simply call Send, then <a href="../lib/Sleep.htm">Sleep</a>, then Send, and so on.</p>
<p><a href="../lib/SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a> exists for the second case. This function can set a delay to be performed between each keystroke, and the duration of the keystroke (i.e. the delay between pressing and releasing the key).</p>
<pre>^1::{
    SetKeyDelay 75, 25  <em>; 75ms between keys, 25ms between down/up.</em>
    SendEvent "You should see the keys{bs 4}text appear gradually."
}</pre>
<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> SendInput does not support key delays, nor does Send by default.</p>
<p>In order to make SetKeyDelay effective, you must generally either use <code>SendMode "Event"</code> or call SendEvent, SendPlay or ControlSend instead of Send or SendText.</p>

<h2 id="Sending_a_lot_of_text">Sending a lot of text</h2>
<p>One way to send multiple lines of text is to use a <a href="../Scripts.htm#continuation-section">continuation section</a>:</p>
<pre>SendText "
(
    Leading indentation is stripped out,
    based on the first line.
    Line breaks are kept
    unless you use the "Join" option.
)"</pre>
<p>Although it is generally quite fast, SendText still has to send each character one at a time, while Send generally needs to send at least twice as many messages (key-down <em>and</em> key-up). This adds up to a noticeable delay when sending a large amount of text. It can also become unreliable, as a longer delay means higher risk of conflict with input by the user, the keyboard focus shifting, or other conditions changing.</p>
<p>Generally it is faster and more reliable to instead place the text on the clipboard and <em>paste</em> it. For example:</p>
<pre>^1::{
    old_clip := ClipboardAll()  <em>; Save all clipboard content</em>
    A_Clipboard := "
    (Join`s
        This text is placed on the clipboard,
        and will be pasted below by sending Ctrl+V.
    )"

<h1>How to Write Hotkeys</h1>
<p>A hotkey is a key or key combination that triggers an action. For example, <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> normally launches File Explorer, and <kbd>F1</kbd> often activates an app-specific help function. AutoHotkey has the power to define hotkeys that can be used anywhere <em>or</em> only within specific apps, performing any action that you are able to express with code.</p>
<p>The most common way to define a hotkey is to write the <em>hotkey name</em> followed by double-colon, then the action:</p>
<pre>#n::Run "notepad"</pre>
<p>This example defines a hotkey that runs Notepad whenever you press <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>. To learn how to try it out, refer to <a href="RunExamples.htm">How to Run Example Code</a>.</p>
<p>For more about running programs, see <a href="RunPrograms.htm">How to Run Programs</a>.</p>
<p>If multiple lines are required, use braces to mark the start and end of the hotkey's action. This is called a <a href="../lib/Block.htm">block</a>.</p>
<pre>#n::
{
    if WinExist("ahk_class Notepad")
        WinActivate  <em>; Activate the window found above</em>
    else
        Run "notepad"  <em>; Open a new Notepad window</em>
}</pre>
<p>The opening brace can also be written on the same line as the hotkey, after <code>::</code>.</p>
<p>The block following a double-colon hotkey is implicitly the body of a <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a>, but that is only important when you define your own <a href="../Concepts.htm#variables">variables</a>. For now, just know that blocks are used to group multiple lines as a single action or <em>statement</em> (see <a href="../Concepts.htm#control-flow">Control Flow</a> if you want to know more about this).</p>

<h2 id="Basic_Hotkeys">Basic Hotkeys</h2>
<p>For most hotkeys, the <em>hotkey name</em> consists of optional modifier symbols immediately followed by a single letter or symbol, or a <a href="../KeyList.htm">key name</a>. Try making the following changes to the example above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove <code>#</code> to make the hotkey activate whenever you press <kbd>N</kbd> on its own. Keep in mind that if something goes wrong, you can always <a href="RunExamples.htm#bailing-out">exit the script</a>.</li>
  <li>Replace <code>#</code> with <code>^</code> for Ctrl, <code>!</code> for Alt or <code>+</code> for Shift, or try combinations.</li>
  <li>Replace <code>#</code> with <code>&lt;^</code> to make it activate only when the <em>left</em> Ctrl key is pressed, or <code>&gt;^</code> for the right Ctrl key, or <em>both</em> to require both keys.</li>
  <li>Replace <code>n</code> with any other letter or symbol (except <code>:</code>).</li>
  <li>Replace <code>n</code> with any name from the <a href="../KeyList.htm">key list</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The last character before <code>::</code> is never interpreted as a modifier symbol.</p>
<p>With this form of hotkey, only the final key in the combination can be written literally as a single character or have its name spelled out in full. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>#::</code> would create a hotkey activated by the hash key, or whatever combination is associated with that symbol (on the US layout, it's <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd>).</li>
  <li><code>##::</code> would create a hotkey like the above, but which activates only if you are also holding the Windows key.</li>
  <li><code>LWin::</code> would create a hotkey activated by pressing down the left Windows key without any other modifier keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common modifiers are Ctrl (<code>^</code>), Alt (<code>!</code>), Shift (<code>+</code>) and Win (<code>#</code>).</p>
<p>The symbols <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> can be prefixed to any one of the above four modifiers to specify the left or right variant of that key. The modifier combination <code>&lt;^&gt;!</code> corresponds to the AltGr key (if present on your keyboard layout), since the operating system implements it as a combination of LCtrl and RAlt.</p>
<p>The other modifiers are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>*</code> (<a href="../Hotkeys.htm#wildcard">wildcard</a>) allows the hotkey to fire even if you are holding modifier keys that the hotkey doesn't include symbols for.</li>
  <li><code>~</code> (<a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Tilde">no-suppress</a>) prevents the hotkey from blocking the key's native function.</li>
  <li><code>$</code> (<a href="../Hotkeys.htm#prefixdollar">use hook</a>) prevents unintentional loops when sending keys, and in some instances makes the hotkey more reliable.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make a hotkey fire only when you release the key instead of when you press it, use the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#keyup">UP suffix</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Symbols">Hotkey Modifier Symbols</a>, <a href="../KeyList.htm">List of Keys</a></p>

<h2 id="Context-sensitive_Hotkeys">Context-sensitive Hotkeys</h2>
<p>The <a href="../lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> directive can be used to specify a condition that must be met for the hotkey to activate, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a window of a specific app is active when you press the hotkey.</li>
  <li>If CapsLock is on when you press the hotkey.</li>
  <li>Any other condition you are able to detect with code.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActive("ahk_class Notepad")
^a::MsgBox "You pressed Ctrl-A while Notepad is active. Pressing Ctrl-A in any other window will pass the Ctrl-A keystroke to that window."
#c::MsgBox "You pressed Win-C while Notepad is active."

#HotIf
#c::MsgBox "You pressed Win-C while any window except Notepad is active."</pre>
<p>You define the condition by writing an <a href="../Language.htm#expressions">expression</a> which is evaluated whenever you press the hotkey. If the expression <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">evaluates to true</a>, the hotkey's action is executed.</p>
<p>The same hotkey can be used multiple times by specifying a different condition for each occurrence of the hotkey, or each <em>hotkey variant</em>. When you press the hotkey, the program executes the first hotkey variant whose condition is met, or the one without a condition (such as the final <code>#c::</code> in the example above).</p>
<p>If the hotkey's condition isn't met and there is no unconditional variant of the hotkey, the keypress is passed on to the active window as though the hotkey wasn't defined in the first place. For instance, if Notepad <em>isn't</em> active while running the example above, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> will perform its normal function (probably Select All).</p>
<p>Try making the following changes to the example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Replace <code>WinActive</code> with <code>WinExist</code> so that the hotkeys activate if Notepad is running, even if Notepad doesn't have the focus.</li>
  <li>Replace the condition with <code>GetKeyState("CapsLock", "T")</code> so that the hotkeys only activate while CapsLock is on.</li>
  <li>Add another ^a or #c hotkey for some other window, such as your web browser or editor. Note that we use <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_class">ahk_class</a> so that the example will work on non-English systems, but you can remove it and use the window's title if you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Correctly identifying which window you want the hotkey to affect sometimes requires using criteria other than the window title. To learn more, see <a href="ManageWindows.htm">How to Manage Windows</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="../lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a>, <a href="../Language.htm#expressions">Expressions</a>, <a href="../lib/WinActive.htm">WinActive</a></p>

<h2 id="Custom_Combinations">Custom Combinations</h2>
<p>A <em>custom combination</em> is a hotkey that combines two keys which aren't normally meant to be used in combination. For example, <code>Numpad0 &amp; Numpad1::</code> defines a hotkey which activates when you hold Numpad0 and press Numpad1.</p>
<p>When you use a key as a prefix in a custom combination, AutoHotkey assumes that you don't want the normal function of the key to activate, since that would interfere with its use as a modifier key. There are two ways to restore the key's normal function:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use another hotkey such as <code>Numpad0::Send "{Numpad0}"</code> to replicate the key's original function. By default, the hotkey will only activate when you <em>release</em> Numpad0, and only if you didn't press Numpad0 and Numpad1 in combination.</li>
  <li>Prefix the combination with <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Tilde">tilde (~)</a>, as in <code>~Numpad0 &amp; Numpad1::</code>. This prevents AutoHotkey from suppressing the normal function of Numpad0, unless you have also defined <code>Numpad0::</code>, in which case the tilde allows the latter hotkey to activate immediately instead of when you release Numpad0.</li>
</ol>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Custom combinations only support combinations of exactly two keys/mouse buttons, and cannot be combined with other modifiers, such as <code>!#^+</code> for Alt, Win, Ctrl and Shift.</p>
<p>Although AutoHotkey does not directly support custom combinations of more than two keys, a similar end result can be achieved by using <a href="../lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a>. If you run the example below, pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>CapsLock</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>+<kbd>CapsLock</kbd> should show a message:</p>
<pre>#HotIf GetKeyState("Ctrl")
Space &amp; CapsLock::
CapsLock &amp; Space::MsgBox "Success!"</pre>
<p>It is necessary to press Ctrl first in this example. This has the advantage that Space and CapsLock perform their normal function if you are not holding Ctrl.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#combo">Custom Combinations</a></p>

<h2 id="Other_Features">Other Features</h2>
<p>AutoHotkey's hotkeys have some other features that are worth exploring. While most applications are limited to combinations of Ctrl, Alt, Shift and sometimes Win with one other key (and often not all keys on the keyboard are supported), AutoHotkey isn't so limited. For further reading, see <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">Hotkeys</a>.</p>

<h1>Array Object</h1>
<pre class="NoIndent">class Array extends Object</pre>

<p>An <strong>Array</strong> object contains a list or sequence of values.</p>
<p>Values are addressed by their position within the array (known as an <em>array index</em>), where position 1 is the first element.</p>
<p>Arrays are often created by enclosing a list of values in brackets. For example:</p>
<pre>veg := ["Asparagus", "Broccoli", "Cucumber"]
Loop veg.Length
    MsgBox veg[A_Index]</pre>
<p>A negative index can be used to address elements in reverse, so -1 is the last element, -2 is the second last element, and so on.</p>
<p>Attempting to use an array index which is out of bounds (such as zero, or if its absolute value is greater than the <a href="#Length">Length</a> of the array) is considered an error and will cause an <a href="Error.htm#IndexError">IndexError</a> to be thrown. The best way to add new elements to the array is to call <a href="#InsertAt">InsertAt</a> or <a href="#Push">Push</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>users := Array()
users.Push A_UserName
MsgBox users[1]</pre>
<p>An array can also be extended by assigning a larger value to <a href="#Length">Length</a>. This changes which indices are valid, but <a href="#Has">Has</a> will show that the new elements have no value. Elements without a value are typically used for <a href="../Functions.htm#VariadicCall">variadic calls</a> or by <a href="../Functions.htm#Variadic">variadic functions</a>, but can be used for any purpose.</p>
<p>"ArrayObj" is used below as a placeholder for any Array object, as "Array" is the class itself.</p>
<p>In addition to the methods and property inherited from <a href="Object.htm">Object</a>, Array objects have the following predefined methods and properties.</p>

<h1>A_Clipboard</h1>

<p><em>A_Clipboard</em> is a <a href="../Concepts.htm#built-in-variables">built-in variable</a> that reflects the current contents of the Windows clipboard if those contents can be expressed as text.</p>

<p id="CopiedFiles">Each line of text on <em>A_Clipboard</em> typically ends with carriage return and linefeed (CR+LF), which can be expressed in the script as <code>`r`n</code>. Files (such as those copied from an open Explorer window via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>) are considered to be text: They are automatically converted to their filenames (with full path) whenever <em>A_Clipboard</em> is referenced in the script. To extract the files one by one, follow this example:</p>

<h1>A_HotkeyModifierTimeout</h1>

<p>Affects the behavior of <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> with <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> modifiers: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, <kbd>Win</kbd>, and <kbd>Shift</kbd>.</p>

<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_HotkeyModifierTimeout</strong> defines how long after a hotkey is pressed that its modifier keys are assumed to still be held down. This is used by <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> to determine whether to push the modifier keys back down after having temporarily released them.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Value</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The length of the interval in milliseconds. The value can be -1 so that it never times out (modifier keys are always pushed back down after the Send), or 0 so that it always times out (modifier keys are never pushed back down).</p>
    <p>The default value is 50.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This variable has no effect when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hotkeys send their keystrokes via the <a href="Send.htm#SendInput">SendInput</a> or <a href="Send.htm#SendPlay">SendPlay</a> methods. This is because those methods postpone the user's physical pressing and releasing of keys until after the Send completes.</li>
  <li>The script has the keyboard hook installed (you can see if your script uses the hook via the "View-&gt;Key history" menu item in the main window, or via the <a href="KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a> function). This is because the hook can keep track of which modifier keys (<kbd>Alt</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Win</kbd>/<kbd>Shift</kbd>) the user is physically holding down and doesn't need to use the timeout.</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate the effect of this variable, consider this example: <code>^!a::Send "abc"</code>.</p>
<p>When the <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> function executes, the first thing it does is release <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> so that the characters get sent properly. After sending all the keys, the function doesn't know whether it can safely push back down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> (to match whether the user is still holding them down). But if less than the specified number of milliseconds have elapsed, it will assume that the user hasn't had a chance to release the keys yet and it will thus push them back down to match their physical state. Otherwise, the modifier keys will not be pushed back down and the user will have to release and press them again to get them to modify the same or another key.</p>
<p>The timeout should be set to a value less than the amount of time that the user typically holds down a hotkey's modifiers before releasing them. Otherwise, the modifiers may be restored to the down position (get stuck down) even when the user isn't physically holding them down.</p>
<p>You can reduce or eliminate the need for this variable with one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Install the keyboard hook by calling <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">InstallKeybdHook</a>.</li>
  <li>Use the <a href="Send.htm#SendInput">SendInput</a> or <a href="Send.htm#SendPlay">SendPlay</a> methods rather than the traditional <a href="Send.htm#SendEvent">SendEvent</a> method.</li>
  <li>When using the traditional <a href="Send.htm#SendEvent">SendEvent</a> method, reduce <a href="SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a> to 0 or -1, which should help because it sends the keystrokes more quickly.</li>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>These built-in variables should usually be assigned values when the script starts (if the default values are not suitable), but the script can get or set their values at any time.</p>
<p>Care should be taken not to make the above too lenient because if you ever inadvertently introduce an infinite loop of keystrokes (via a <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> function that accidentally triggers other hotkeys), your computer could become unresponsive due to the rapid flood of keyboard events.</p>
<p>As an oversimplified example, the hotkey <code>^c::Send "^c"</code> would produce an infinite loop of keystrokes. To avoid this, add the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#prefixdollar">$ prefix</a> to the hotkey definition (e.g. <code>$^c::</code>) so that the hotkey cannot be triggered by the Send function.</p>
<p>The limit might be reached by means other than an infinite loop, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Key-repeat when the limit is too low relative to the key-repeat rate, or the system is under heavy load.</li>
  <li>Keyboard or mouse hardware which sends input events more rapidly than the typical key-repeat rate. For example, tilting the wheel left or right on some mice sends a rapid flood of events which may reach the limit for hotkeys such as <code>WheelLeft::</code> and <code>WheelRight::</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To disable the warning dialog entirely, assign <code>A_HotkeyInterval := 0</code>.</p>

    <p>A vkNNscNNN sequence identifying the virtual key code (NN) and scan code (NNN), in hexadecimal, or an empty string if masking is disabled.</p>
    <p>The script can also assign a <a href="../KeyList.htm">key name</a>, <a href="../KeyList.htm#vk">vkNN</a> sequence or <a href="../KeyList.htm#sc">scNNN</a> sequence, in which case generally either the VK or SC code is left as zero until the key is sent, then determined automatically. Assigning "vk00sc000" disables masking and is equivalent to assigning "".</p>
    <p>The returned string is always a vkNNscNNN sequence if enabled or "" if disabled, regardless of how it was assigned. All vkNNscNNN sequences and all non-zero vkNN or scNNN sequences are permitted, but some combinations may fail to suppress the menu. Any other invalid keys cause a <a href="Error.htm#ValueError">ValueError</a> to be thrown.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The mask key is sent automatically to prevent the Start menu or the active window's menu bar from activating at unexpected times.</p>
<p>The default mask key is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. This variable can be used to change the mask key to a key with fewer side effects.</p>
<p>Good candidates are virtual key codes which generally have no effect, such as vkE8, which Microsoft documents as "unassigned", or vkFF, which is reserved to mean "no mapping" (a key which has no function). Some values, such as zero VK with non-zero SC, may fail to suppress the Start menu. Key codes are not required to match an existing key.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Microsoft can assign an effect to an unassigned key code at any time. For example, vk07 was once undefined and safe to use, but since Windows 10 1909 it is reserved for opening the game bar.</p>
<p>This setting is global, meaning that it needs to be specified only once to affect the behavior of the entire script.</p>
<p><strong>Hotkeys:</strong> If a hotkey is implemented using the keyboard hook or mouse hook, the final keypress may be invisible to the active window and the system. If the system was to detect <em>only</em> a Win or Alt keydown and keyup with no intervening keypress, it would usually activate a menu. To prevent this, the keyboard or mouse hook may automatically send the mask key.</p>
<p>Pressing a hook hotkey causes the next Alt or Win keyup to be masked if all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The hotkey is suppressed (it lacks the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Tilde">tilde modifier</a>).</li>
  <li><kbd>Alt</kbd> or <kbd>Win</kbd> is logically down when the hotkey is pressed.</li>
  <li>The modifier is physically down or the hotkey requires the modifier to activate. For example, <code>$#a::</code> in combination with <code>AppsKey::RWin</code> causes masking when <kbd>Menu</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> is pressed, but <kbd>Menu</kbd> on its own is able to open the Start Menu.</li>
  <li><kbd>Alt</kbd> is not masked if <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> was down when the hotkey was pressed, since <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd> does not activate the menu bar.</li>
  <li><kbd>Win</kbd> is not masked if the most recent Win keydown was modified with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd>, since the Start Menu does not normally activate in those cases. However, key-repeat occurs even for <kbd>Win</kbd> if it was the last key physically pressed, so it can be hard to predict <em>when</em> the most recent Win keydown was.</li>
  <li>Either the keyboard hook is not installed (i.e. for a mouse hotkey), or there have been no other (unsuppressed) keydown or keyup events since the last Alt or Win keydown. Note that key-repeat occurs even for modifier keys and even after sending other keys, but only for the last physically pressed key.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mouse hotkeys may send the mask key immediately if the keyboard hook is not installed.</p>
<p>Hotkeys with the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Tilde">tilde modifier</a> are not intended to block the native function of the key, so they do not cause masking. Hotkeys like <code>~#a::</code> still suppress the menu, since the system detects that <kbd>Win</kbd> has been used in combination with another key. However, mouse hotkeys and both <kbd>Win</kbd> themselves (<code>~LWin::</code> and <code>~RWin::</code>) do not suppress the Start Menu.</p>
<p>The Start Menu (or the active window's menu bar) can be suppressed by sending any keystroke. The following example disables the ability for the left <kbd>Win</kbd> to activate the Start Menu, while still allowing its use as a modifier:</p>
<pre>~LWin::Send "{Blind}{vkE8}"</pre>
<p><strong>Send:</strong> <a href="Send.htm">Send</a>, <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a> and related often release modifier keys as part of their normal operation. For example, the hotkey <code>&lt;#a::SendText Address</code> usually must release the left <kbd>Win</kbd> prior to sending the contents of <em>Address</em>, and press the left <kbd>Win</kbd> back down afterward (so that other Win key combinations continue working). The mask key may be sent in such cases to prevent a Win or Alt keyup from activating a menu.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A block is used to bind two or more <a href="../Concepts.htm#statement">statements</a> together. It can also be used to change which <a href="If.htm">If statement</a> an <a href="Else.htm">Else statement</a> belongs to, as in this example where the block forces the Else statement to belong to the first If statement rather than the second:</p>
<pre>if (Var1 = 1)

    if (Var2 = "abc")
        Sleep 1
}
else

<p>Although blocks can be used anywhere, currently they are only meaningful when used with <a href="../Functions.htm#define">function definitions</a>, <a href="If.htm">If</a>, <a href="Else.htm">Else</a>, <a href="../Language.htm#loop-statement">Loop statements</a>, <a href="Try.htm">Try</a>, <a href="Catch.htm">Catch</a> or <a href="Finally.htm">Finally</a>.</p>
<p>If any of the control flow statements mentioned above has only a single statement, that statement need not be enclosed in a block (this does not work for function definitions). However, there may be cases where doing so enhances the readability or maintainability of the script.</p>
<p>A block may be empty (contain zero statements), which may be useful in cases where you want to comment out the contents of the block without removing the block itself.</p>
<p id="otb"><strong>One True Brace (OTB, K&amp;R style):</strong> The OTB style may optionally be used in the following places: <a href="../Functions.htm#define">function definitions</a>, <a href="If.htm">If</a>, <a href="Else.htm">Else</a>, <a href="../Language.htm#loop-statement">Loop</a>, <a href="While.htm">While</a>, <a href="For.htm">For</a>, <a href="Try.htm">Try</a>, <a href="Catch.htm">Catch</a>, and <a href="Finally.htm">Finally</a>. This style puts the block's opening brace on the same line as the block's controlling statement rather than underneath on a line by itself. For example:</p>
<pre>MyFunction(x, y) {
    ...
}
if (x &lt; y) {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
Loop RepeatCount {
    ...
}
While x &lt; y {
    ...
}
For k, v in obj {
    ...
}
Try {
    ...
} Catch Error {
    ...
} Finally {
    ....
}</pre>
<p>Similarly, a statement may exist to the right of a brace (except the open-brace of the One True Brace style). For example:</p>
<pre>if (x = 1)
{ MsgBox "This line appears to the right of an opening brace. It executes whenever the IF-statement is true."
    MsgBox "This is the next line."
} MsgBox "This line appears to the right of a closing brace. It executes unconditionally."</pre>

<p>Disables or enables the user's ability to interact with the computer via keyboard and mouse.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">BlockInput</span> OnOff
<span class="func">BlockInput</span> SendMouse
<span class="func">BlockInput</span> MouseMove</pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>OnOff</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>This mode blocks all user inputs unconditionally. Specify one of the following values:</p>
    <p><strong>On</strong> or 1 (<a href="../Variables.htm#True">true</a>): The user is prevented from interacting with the computer (mouse and keyboard input has no effect).</p>
    <p><strong>Off</strong> or 0 (<a href="../Variables.htm#False">false</a>): Input is re-enabled.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>SendMouse</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>This mode only blocks user inputs while specific send and/or mouse functions are in progress. Specify one of the following words:</p>
    <p><strong>Send</strong>: The user's keyboard and mouse input is ignored while a <a href="Send.htm">SendEvent</a> is in progress (including <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> and <a href="Send.htm">SendText</a> if <code>SendMode "Event"</code> has been used). This prevents the user's keystrokes from disrupting the flow of simulated keystrokes. When the Send finishes, input is re-enabled (unless still blocked by a previous use of <code>BlockInput "On"</code>).</p>
    <p><strong>Mouse</strong>: The user's keyboard and mouse input is ignored while a <a href="Click.htm">Click</a>, <a href="MouseMove.htm">MouseMove</a>, <a href="MouseClick.htm">MouseClick</a>, or <a href="MouseClickDrag.htm">MouseClickDrag</a> is in progress (the traditional <a href="SendMode.htm">SendEvent mode</a> only). This prevents the user's mouse movements and clicks from disrupting the simulated mouse events. When the mouse action finishes, input is re-enabled (unless still blocked by a previous use of <code>BlockInput "On"</code>).</p>
    <p><strong>SendAndMouse</strong>: A combination of the above two modes.</p>
    <p><strong>Default</strong>: Turns off both the <em>Send</em> and the <em>Mouse</em> modes, but does not change the current state of input blocking. For example, if <code>BlockInput "On"</code> is currently in effect, using <code>BlockInput "Default"</code> will not turn it off.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="MouseMove">MouseMove</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>This mode only blocks the mouse cursor movement. Specify one of the following words:</p>
    <p><strong>MouseMove</strong>: The mouse cursor will not move in response to the user's physical movement of the mouse (DirectInput applications are a possible exception). When a script first uses this function, the <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse hook</a> is installed (if it is not already). The mouse hook will stay installed until the next use of the <a href="Suspend.htm">Suspend</a> or <a href="Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> function, at which time it is removed if not required by any hotkeys or hotstrings (see <a href="_Hotstring.htm">#Hotstring NoMouse</a>).</p>
    <p><strong>MouseMoveOff</strong>: Allows the user to move the mouse cursor.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>All three BlockInput modes (<em>OnOff</em>, <em>SendMouse</em> and <em>MouseMove</em>) operate independently of each other. For example, <code>BlockInput "On"</code> will continue to block input until <code>BlockInput "Off"</code> is used, even if one of the words from <em>SendMouse</em> is also in effect. Another example is, if <code>BlockInput "On"</code> and <code>BlockInput "MouseMove"</code> are both in effect, mouse movement will be blocked until both are turned off.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>OnOff</em> and <em>SendMouse</em> modes might have no effect if UAC is enabled or the script has not been run as administrator. For more information, refer to the <a href="../FAQ.htm#uac">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>In preference to BlockInput, it is often better to use <code><a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> "Input"</code> or <code><a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> "Play"</code> so that keystrokes and mouse clicks become uninterruptible. This is because unlike BlockInput, those modes do not discard what the user types during the send; instead, those keystrokes are buffered and sent afterward. Avoiding BlockInput also avoids the need to work around sticking keys as described in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>If BlockInput becomes active while the user is holding down keys, it might cause those keys to become "stuck down". This can be avoided by waiting for the keys to be released prior to turning BlockInput on, as in this example:</p>
<pre>^!p::
{
    KeyWait "Control"  <em>; Wait for the key to be released.  Use one KeyWait for each of the hotkey's modifiers.</em>
    KeyWait "Alt"
    BlockInput True
    <em>; ... send keystrokes and mouse clicks ...</em>
    BlockInput False
}</pre>
<p>When BlockInput is in effect, user input is blocked but AutoHotkey can simulate keystrokes and mouse clicks. However, pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd> will re-enable input due to a Windows API feature.</p>
<p>Certain types of <a href="_UseHook.htm">hook hotkeys</a> can still be triggered when BlockInput is on. Examples include <code>MButton</code> (mouse hook) and <code>LWin &amp; Space</code> (keyboard hook with explicit prefix rather than modifiers "$#").</p>
<p>Input is automatically re-enabled when the script closes.</p>

<h1>Buffer Object</h1>
<pre class="NoIndent">class Buffer extends Object</pre>

<p>Encapsulates a block of memory for use with advanced techniques such as DllCall, structures, StrPut and raw file I/O.</p>
<p>Buffer objects are typically created by calling <a href="#Call">Buffer()</a>, but can also be returned by <a href="FileRead.htm">FileRead</a> with the "RAW" option.</p>
<pre>BufferObj := Buffer(ByteCount)</pre>
<p><a href="ClipboardAll.htm">ClipboardAll</a> returns a sub-type of Buffer, also named ClipboardAll.</p>
<pre>class ClipboardAll extends Buffer</pre>

<p>"BufferObj" is used below as a placeholder for any Buffer object, as "Buffer" is the class itself.</p>
<p>In addition to the methods and property inherited from <a href="Object.htm">Object</a>, Buffer objects have the following predefined properties.</p>

<h2 id="toc">Table of Contents</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#like">Buffer-like Objects</a></li>
  <li><a href="#StaticMethods">Static Methods</a>:

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#Methods">Methods</a>:

</ul>

<h2 id="like">Buffer-like Objects</h2>
<p>Some built-in functions accept a Buffer object in place of an address - see the <a href="#Related">Related</a> section for links. These functions also accept any other object which has <a href="#Ptr">Ptr</a> and <a href="#Size">Size</a> properties, but are optimized for the native Buffer object.</p>
<p>In most cases, passing a Buffer object is safer than passing an address, as the function can read the <a href="#Size">buffer size</a> to ensure that it does not attempt to access any memory location outside of the buffer. One exception is that <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> calls functions outside of the program; in those cases, it may be necessary to explicitly pass the <a href="#Size">buffer size</a> to the function.</p>

<h2 id="StaticMethods">Static Methods</h2>
<div class="methodShort" id="Call"><h3>Call</h3>

    <p>Specify a number between 0 and 255 to set each byte in the buffer to that number.</p>
    <p>This should generally be omitted in cases where the buffer will be written into without first being read, as it has a time-cost proportionate to the number of bytes. If omitted, the memory of the buffer is not initialized; the value of each byte is arbitrary.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#MemoryError">MemoryError</a> is thrown if the memory could not be allocated, such as if <em>ByteCount</em> is unexpectedly large or the system is low on virtual memory.</p>
<p>Parameters are defined by <a href="#__New">__New</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Methods">Methods</h2>

<p>Allocates or reallocates the buffer and optionally fills it.</p>

<p>This method exists to support <a href="#Call">Call</a>, and is not usually called directly. See <a href="../Objects.htm#Custom_NewDelete">Construction and Destruction</a>.</p>
<p>Specify <em>ByteCount</em> to allocate, reallocate or free the buffer. This is equivalent to assigning <a href="#Size">Size</a>.</p>
<p>Specify <em>FillByte</em> to fill the buffer with the given numeric byte value, overwriting any existing content.</p>
<p>If both parameters are omitted, this method has no effect.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Properties">Properties</h2>
<div class="methodShort" id="Ptr"><h3>Ptr</h3>
<p>Retrieves the buffer's current memory address.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Ptr := BufferObj.Ptr</pre>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>Any address returned by this property becomes invalid when the buffer is freed or reallocated. Invalid addresses must not be used. The buffer is not freed until the Buffer object's <a href="../Objects.htm#Reference_Counting">reference count</a> reaches zero, but it is reallocated when its <a href="#Size">Size</a> is changed.</p>
</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="Size"><h3>Size</h3>

<pre class="Syntax">ByteCount := BufferObj.Size</pre>
<pre class="Syntax">BufferObj.Size := ByteCount</pre>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>The buffer's address typically changes whenever its size is changed. If the size is decreased, the data within the buffer is truncated, but the remaining bytes are preserved. If the size is increased, all data is preserved and the values of any new bytes are arbitrary (they are not initialized, for performance reasons).</p>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#MemoryError">MemoryError</a> is thrown if the memory could not be allocated, such as if <em>ByteCount</em> is unexpectedly large or the system is low on virtual memory.</p>

    <p>A <a href="../Functions.htm#closures">closure</a> or <a href="../misc/Functor.htm#BoundFunc">bound function</a> can be used to differentiate between multiple callbacks which all call the same script function.</p>
    <p>The callback retains a reference to the function object, and releases it when the script calls <a href="#CallbackFree">CallbackFree</a>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Options</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>Specify zero or more of the following words or characters. Separate each option from the next with a space (e.g. <code>"C Fast"</code>).</p>
    <p id="Fast"><strong>Fast</strong> or <strong>F</strong>: Avoids starting a new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> each time <em>Function</em> is called. Although this performs better, it must be avoided whenever the thread from which <em>Address</em> is called varies (e.g. when the callback is triggered by an incoming message). This is because <em>Function</em> will be able to change global settings such as <a href="../Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> and the <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow">last-found window</a> for whichever thread happens to be running at the time it is called. For more information, see <a href="#Threads">Remarks</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>CDecl</strong> or <strong>C</strong>: Makes <em>Address</em> conform to the "C" calling convention. This is typically omitted because the standard calling convention is much more common for callbacks. This option is ignored by 64-bit versions of AutoHotkey, which use the x64 calling convention.</p>
    <p><strong>&amp;</strong>: Causes the address of the parameter list (a single integer) to be passed to <em>Function</em> instead of the individual parameters. Parameter values can be retrieved by using <a href="NumGet.htm">NumGet</a>. When using the standard 32-bit calling convention, <em>ParamCount</em> must specify the size of the parameter list in DWORDs (the number of bytes divided by 4).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>ParamCount</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The number of parameters that <em>Address</em>'s caller will pass to it. If omitted, it defaults to <a href="Func.htm#MinParams"><i>Function</i>.MinParams</a>, which is usually the number of mandatory parameters in the <a href="../Functions.htm#define">definition</a> of <em>Function</em>. In either case, ensure that the caller passes exactly this number of parameters.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>CallbackCreate returns a machine-code address. This address is typically passed to an external function via <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> or placed in a struct using <a href="NumPut.htm">NumPut</a>, but can also be called directly by DllCall. Passing the address to <a href="#CallbackFree">CallbackFree</a> will delete the callback.</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>This function fails and throws an exception under any of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Function</em> is not an object, or has neither a <code>MinParams</code> property nor a <code>Call</code> method.</li>
  <li><em>Function</em> has a <code>MinParams</code> property which exceeds the number of parameters that the callback will supply.</li>
  <li><em>ParamCount</em> is negative.</li>
  <li><em>ParamCount</em> is omitted and: 1) <em>Function</em> has no <code>MinParams</code> property; or 2) the <code>&amp;</code> option is used with the standard 32-bit calling convention.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="The_Callback_Functions_Parameters">The Callback Function's Parameters</h2>
<p>A <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a> assigned to a callback address may accept up to 31 parameters. <a href="../Functions.htm#optional">Optional parameters</a> are permitted, which is useful when the function is called by more than one caller.</p>
<p>Interpreting the parameters correctly requires some understanding of how the x86 calling conventions work. Since AutoHotkey does not have typed parameters, the callback's parameter list is assumed to consist of integers, and some reinterpretation may be required.</p>

<p><strong>AutoHotkey 32-bit:</strong> All incoming parameters are unsigned 32-bit integers. Smaller types are padded out to 32 bits, while larger types are split into a series of 32-bit parameters.</p>
<p>If an incoming parameter is intended to be a signed integer, any negative numbers can be revealed by following either of the following examples:</p>
<pre><em>; Method #1</em>
if (wParam &gt; 0x7FFFFFFF)
    wParam := -(~wParam) - 1

<em>; Method #2: Relies on the fact that AutoHotkey natively uses signed 64-bit integers.</em>
wParam := wParam &lt;&lt; 32 &gt;&gt; 32</pre>

<p><strong>AutoHotkey 64-bit:</strong> All incoming parameters are signed 64-bit integers. AutoHotkey does not natively support unsigned 64-bit integers. Smaller types are padded out to 64 bits, while larger types are always passed by address.</p>

<p><strong>AutoHotkey 32-bit/64-bit:</strong> If an incoming parameter is intended to be 8-bit or 16-bit (or 32-bit on x64), the upper bits of the value might contain "garbage" which can be filtered out by using bitwise-and, as in the following examples:</p>
<pre>Callback(UCharParam, UShortParam, UIntParam) {
    UCharParam &amp;= 0xFF
    UShortParam &amp;= 0xFFFF
    UIntParam &amp;= 0xFFFFFFFF
    <em>;...</em>
}</pre>
<p>If an incoming parameter is intended by its caller to be a string, what it actually receives is the address of the string. To retrieve the string itself, use <a href="StrGet.htm">StrGet</a>:</p>
<pre>MyString := StrGet(MyParameter)</pre>
<p>If an incoming parameter is the address of a structure, the individual members may be extracted by following the steps at <a href="DllCall.htm#struct">DllCall structures</a>.</p>

<p id="Indirect"><strong>Receiving parameters by address:</strong> If the <code>&amp;</code> option is used, the function receives the <i>address</i> of the first callback parameter. For example:</p>
<pre>
callback := CallbackCreate(TheFunc, "F&amp;", 3)  <em>; Parameter list size must be specified for 32-bit.</em>
DllCall(callback, "float", 10.5, "int64", 42)
TheFunc(params) {
    MsgBox <a href="NumGet.htm">NumGet</a>(params, 0, "float") ", " NumGet(params, A_PtrSize, "int64")
}</pre>
<p>Most callbacks in 32-bit programs use the <em>stdcall</em> calling convention, which requires a fixed number of parameters. In those cases, <em>ParamCount</em> must be set to the size of the parameter list, where Int64 and Double count as two 32-bit parameters. With <em>Cdecl</em> or the 64-bit calling convention, <em>ParamCount</em> has no effect.</p>

<h2 id="What_the_Function_Should_Return">What the Function Should <em>Return</em></h2>
<p>If the function uses <a href="Return.htm">Return</a> without any parameters, or it specifies a blank value such as "" (or it never uses Return at all), 0 is returned to the caller of the callback. Otherwise, the function should return an integer, which is then returned to the caller. AutoHotkey 32-bit truncates return values to 32-bit, while AutoHotkey 64-bit supports 64-bit return values. Returning structs larger than this (by value) is not supported.</p>

<h2 id="Threads">Fast vs. Slow</h2>
<p>The default/slow mode causes the function to start off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> and <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a>. These defaults can be changed during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>.</p>
<p>By contrast, the <a href="#Fast">fast mode</a> inherits global settings from whichever <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> happens to be running at the time the function is called. Furthermore, any changes the function makes to global settings (including the <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow">last-found window</a>) will go into effect for the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a>. Consequently, the fast mode should be used only when it is known exactly which thread(s) the function will be called from.</p>
<p>To avoid being interrupted by itself (or any other thread), a callback may use <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> as its first line. However, this is not completely effective when the function is called indirectly via the arrival of a message less than 0x0312 (increasing Critical's <a href="Critical.htm#Interval">interval</a> may help). Furthermore, <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> does not prevent the function from doing something that might indirectly result in a call to itself, such as calling <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> or <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>.</p>

<h2 id="CallbackFree">CallbackFree</h2>
<p>Deletes a callback and releases its reference to the function object.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">CallbackFree</span>(Address)</pre>
<p>Each use of CallbackCreate allocates a small amount of memory (32 or 48 bytes plus system overhead). Since the OS frees this memory automatically when the script exits, any script that allocates a small, <em>fixed</em> number of callbacks can get away with not explicitly freeing the memory.</p>
<p>However, if the function object held by the callback is of a dynamic nature (such as a <a href="../Functions.htm#closures">closure</a> or <a href="../misc/Functor.htm#BoundFunc">bound function</a>), it can be especially important to free the callback when it is no longer needed; otherwise, the function object will not be released.</p>

<p>The string corresponding to <em>Number</em>.

<p>If <em>Number</em> is 0, the return value is a string containing a binary null character, not an empty (zero-length) string.

<h1>Class Object</h1>
<pre class="NoIndent">class Class extends Object</pre>

<p>A <strong>Class</strong> object represents a class definition; it contains static methods and properties.</p>
<p>Each class object is <a href="../Objects.htm#Custom_Objects">based on</a> whatever class it extends, or <a href="Object.htm">Object</a> if not specified. The global class object <code>Object</code> is based on <code>Class.Prototype</code>, which is based on <code>Object.Prototype</code>, so classes can inherit methods and properties from any of these base objects.</p>
<p>"Static" methods and properties are any methods and properties which are owned by the class object itself (and therefore do not apply to a specific instance), while methods and properties for instances of the class are owned by the class's <a href="#Prototype">Prototype</a>.</p>
<p>"ClassObj" is used below as a placeholder for any class object, as "Class" is the Class class itself. Ordinarily, one refers to a class object by the name given in its <a href="../Objects.htm#Custom_Classes">class definition</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc">Table of Contents</h2>
<ul class="indent">
  <li><a href="#Methods">Methods</a>:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#Call">Call</a>: Constructs a new instance of the class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#Properties">Properties</a>:

<div class="methodShort" id="Call"><h3>Call</h3>
<p>Constructs a new instance of the class.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Obj := ClassObj(Params*)
Obj := ClassObj.<span class="func">Call</span>(Params*)</pre>
<p>This static method is typically inherited from the <a href="Object.htm">Object</a>, <a href="Array.htm">Array</a> or <a href="Map.htm">Map</a> class. It performs the following functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allocate memory and initialize the binary structure of the object, which depends on the object's native type (e.g. whether it is an Array or Map, or just an Object).</li>
  <li>Set the base of the new object to <a href="#Prototype">ClassObj.Prototype</a>.</li>
  <li>Call the new object's __Init method, if it has one. This method is automatically created by class definitions; it contains all instance variable initializers defined within the class body.</li>
  <li>Call the new object's __New method, if it has one. All parameters passed to Call are forwarded on to __New.</li>
  <li>Return the new object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Call can be overridden within a class definition by defining a static method, such as <code>static Call()</code>. This allows classes to modify or prevent the construction of new instances.</p>
<p>Note that <code>Class()</code> (literally using "Class" in this case) can be used to construct a new Class object based on <code>Class.Prototype</code>. However, this new object initially has no Call method as it is not a subclass of <a href="Object.htm">Object</a>. It can become a subclass of Object by assigning to <a href="Object.htm#Base">Base</a>, or the Call method can be reimplemented or copied from another class. A <a href="#Prototype">Prototype</a> must also be created and assigned to the class before it can be instantiated with the standard Call method.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Properties">Properties</h2>

<div class="methodShort" id="Prototype"><h3>Prototype</h3>
<p>Retrieves or sets the object on which all instances of the class are based.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Proto := ClassObj.<span class="func">Prototype</span></pre>
<pre class="Syntax">ClassObj.<span class="func">Prototype</span> := Proto</pre>
<p>By default, the class's Prototype contains all instance methods and dynamic properties defined within the class definition, and can be used to retrieve references to methods or property getters/setters or define new ones. The script can also define new value properties, which act as default property values for all instances.</p>
<p>A class's Prototype is normally based on the Prototype of its base class, so <code>ClassObj.Prototype.base == ClassObj.base.Prototype</code>.</p>
<p>Prototype is automatically defined as an own property of any class object created by a class definition.</p>

<h1>Click</h1>

<p>Clicks a mouse button at the specified coordinates. It can also hold down a mouse button, turn the mouse wheel, or move the mouse.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Click</span> <span class="optional">Options</span></pre>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Options</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify zero or more of the following components: <var>Coords</var>, <var>WhichButton</var>, <var>ClickCount</var>, <var>DownOrUp</var>, and/or <var>Relative</var>. Separate each component from the next with at least one space, tab, and/or comma (within a string or as separate parameters). The components can appear in any order except <var>ClickCount</var>, which must occur somewhere to the right of <var>Coords</var>, if present.</p>
    <p><strong>Coords:</strong> The X and Y coordinates to which the mouse cursor is moved prior to clicking. For example, <code>Click "100 200"</code> clicks the left mouse button at a specific position. Coordinates are relative to the active window's client area unless <a href="CoordMode.htm">CoordMode</a> was used to change that. If omitted, the cursor's current position is used.</p>
    <p><strong>WhichButton:</strong> Left (default), Right, Middle (or just the first letter of each of these); or the fourth or fifth mouse button (X1 or X2). For example, <code>Click "Right"</code> clicks the right mouse button at the mouse cursor's current position. Left and Right correspond to the primary button and secondary button. If the user swaps the buttons via system settings, the physical positions of the buttons are swapped but the effect stays the same.</p>
    <p><var>WhichButton</var> can also be WheelUp or WU to turn the wheel upward (away from you), or WheelDown or WD to turn the wheel downward (toward you). WheelLeft (or WL) or WheelRight (or WR) may also be specified. For <var>ClickCount</var>, specify the number of notches to turn the wheel. However, some applications do not obey a <var>ClickCount</var> value higher than 1 for the mouse wheel. For them, use the Click function multiple times by means such as <a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>ClickCount:</strong> The number of times to click the mouse. For example, <code>Click 2</code> performs a double-click at the mouse cursor's current position. If omitted, the button is clicked once. If <var>Coords</var> is specified, <var>ClickCount</var> must appear after it. Specify zero (0) to move the mouse without clicking; for example, <code>Click "100 200 0"</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>DownOrUp:</strong> This component is normally omitted, in which case each click consists of a down-event followed by an up-event. Otherwise, specify the word Down (or the letter D) to press the mouse button down without releasing it. Later, use the word Up (or the letter U) to release the mouse button. For example, <code>Click "Down"</code> presses down the left mouse button and holds it.</p>
    <p><strong>Relative:</strong> The word Rel or Relative treats the specified X and Y coordinates as offsets from the current mouse position. In other words, the cursor will be moved from its current position by X pixels to the right (left if negative) and Y pixels down (up if negative).</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The Click function uses the sending method set by <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>. To override this mode for a particular click, use a specific Send function in combination with <a href="Send.htm#Click">{Click}</a>, as in this example: <code>SendEvent "{Click 100 200}"</code>.</p>
<p>To perform a shift-click or control-click, <a href="Send.htm#Click">clicking via Send</a> is generally easiest. For example:</p>
<pre>Send "+{Click 100 200}"  <em>; Shift+LeftClick</em>
Send "^{Click 100 200 Right}"  <em>; Control+RightClick</em></pre>
<p>Unlike <a href="Send.htm">Send</a>, the Click function does not automatically release the modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and Win). For example, if <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is currently down, <code>Click</code> would produce a control-click but <code>Send "{Click}"</code> would produce a normal click.</p>
<p>The <a href="SendMode.htm">SendPlay mode</a> is able to successfully generate mouse events in a broader variety of games than the other modes. In addition, some applications and games may have trouble tracking the mouse if it moves too quickly, in which case <a href="SetDefaultMouseSpeed.htm">SetDefaultMouseSpeed</a> can be used to reduce the speed (but only in <a href="SendMode.htm">SendEvent mode</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="BlockInput.htm">BlockInput</a> function can be used to prevent any physical mouse activity by the user from disrupting the simulated mouse events produced by the mouse functions. However, this is generally not needed for the <a href="SendMode.htm">SendInput</a> and <a href="SendMode.htm">SendPlay</a> modes because they automatically postpone the user's physical mouse activity until afterward.</p>
<p>There is an automatic delay after every click-down and click-up of the mouse (except for <a href="SendMode.htm">SendInput mode</a> and for turning the mouse wheel). Use <a href="SetMouseDelay.htm">SetMouseDelay</a> to change the length of the delay.</p>

<h1>ClipboardAll</h1>

<p>Creates an object containing everything on the clipboard (such as pictures and formatting).</p>
<pre class="Syntax">ClipSaved := <span class="func">ClipboardAll</span>(<span class="optional">Data, Size</span>)</pre>
<p><em></em><code>ClipboardAll</code> itself is a <a href="Class.htm">class</a> derived from <code>Buffer</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<p>Omit both parameters to retrieve the current contents of the clipboard. Otherwise, specify one or both parameters to create an object containing the given binary clipboard data.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Data</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#objects">Object</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>A <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a>-like object or a pure integer which is the address of the binary data. The data must be in a specific format, so typically originates from a previous call to ClipboardAll. See <a href="#ExFile">example #2</a> below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Size</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The number of bytes of data to use. This is optional when <em>Data</em> is an object.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="clipboardall-object">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#objects">Object</a></p>
<p>This function returns a ClipboardAll object, which has two properties (inherited from <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a>):</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Buffer.htm#Ptr">Ptr</a>: The address of the data contained by the object. This address is valid until the object is freed.</li>
  <li><a href="Buffer.htm#Size">Size</a>: The size, in bytes, of the raw binary data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The built-in variable <a href="A_Clipboard.htm">A_Clipboard</a> reflects the current contents of the Windows clipboard expressed as plain text, but can be assigned a ClipboardAll object to restore its content to the clipboard.</p>
<p><em>ClipboardAll</em> is most commonly used to save the clipboard's contents so that the script can temporarily use the clipboard for an operation. When the operation is completed, the script restores the original clipboard contents as shown in <a href="#ExVar">example #1</a> and <a href="#ExFile">example #2</a>.</p>
<p>If <em>ClipboardAll</em> cannot retrieve one or more of the data objects (formats) on the clipboard, they will be omitted but all the remaining objects will be stored.</p>
<p><a href="ClipWait.htm">ClipWait</a> may be used to detect when the clipboard contains data (optionally including non-text data).</p>
<p>The binary data contained by the object consists of a four-byte format type, followed by a four-byte data-block size, followed by the data-block for that format. If the clipboard contained more than one format (which is almost always the case), these three items are repeated until all the formats are included. The data ends with a four-byte format type of 0.</p>
<p>Known limitation: Using <em>ClipboardAll</em> while cells from Microsoft Excel are on the clipboard may cause Excel to display a "no printers" dialog.</p>

<h1>ClipWait</h1>

<p>Waits until the <a href="A_Clipboard.htm">clipboard</a> contains data.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">ClipWait</span> <span class="optional">Timeout, WaitForAnyData</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Timeout</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If omitted, the function will wait indefinitely. Otherwise, it will wait no longer than this many seconds (can contain a decimal point).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>WaitForAnyData</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If this parameter is omitted or 0 (false), the function is more selective, waiting specifically for text or files to appear ("text" includes anything that would produce text when you paste into Notepad). If this parameter is 1 (true), the function waits for data of any kind to appear on the clipboard.</p>
    <p>Other values are reserved for future use.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">Integer (boolean)</a></p>
<p>This function returns 0 (false) if the function timed out or 1 (true) otherwise (i.e. the clipboard contains data).</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>It's better to use this function than a loop of your own that checks to see if this clipboard is blank. This is because the clipboard is never opened by this function, and thus it performs better and avoids any chance of interfering with another application that may be using the clipboard.</p>
<p>This function considers anything convertible to text (e.g. HTML) to be text. It also considers files, such as those copied in an Explorer window via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, to be text. Such files are automatically converted to their filenames (with full path) whenever the clipboard variable is referred to in the script. See <a href="A_Clipboard.htm">A_Clipboard</a> for details.</p>
<p>When 1 (true) is present as the last parameter, the function will be satisfied when any data appears on the clipboard. This can be used in conjunction with <a href="ClipboardAll.htm">ClipboardAll</a> to save non-textual items such as pictures.</p>
<p>While the function is in a waiting state, new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> can be launched via <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a>.</p>
<p>To wait for a fraction of a second, specify a floating point value for the first parameter, for example, 0.25 to wait for a maximum of 250 milliseconds.</p>

<h1>ComCall</h1>

<p>Calls a native COM interface method by index.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Index</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
      <p>The zero-based index of the method within the virtual function table.</p>
      <p><em>Index</em> corresponds to the position of the method within the original interface definition. Microsoft documentation usually lists methods in alphabetical order, which is not relevant. In order to determine the correct index, locate the original interface definition. This may be in a header file or type library.</p>
      <p>It is important to take into account methods which are inherited from parent interfaces. Since all COM interfaces ultimately derive from <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a>, the first three methods are always QueryInterface (0), AddRef (1) and Release (2). For example, <em>IShellItem2</em> is an extension of <em>IShellItem</em>, which starts at index 3 and contains 5 methods, so <em>IShellItem2</em>'s first method (GetPropertyStore) is at index 8.</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong> For COM interfaces defined by Microsoft, try searching the Internet or Windows SDK for "<em>IInterfaceName</em><b>Vtbl</b>" - for example, "IUnknownVtbl". Microsoft's own interface definitions are accompanied by this plain-C definition of the interface's virtual function table, which lists all methods explicitly, in the correct order.</p>
      <p>Passing an invalid index may cause undefined behaviour, including (but not limited to) program termination.</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>ComObj</dt>

      <p>The target COM object; that is, a COM interface pointer. The pointer value can be passed directly or encapsulated within an object with the <code>Ptr</code> property, such as a <a href="ComValue.htm">ComValue</a> with variant type VT_UNKNOWN.</p>
      <p>The interface pointer is used to locate the address of the virtual function which implements the interface method, and is also passed as a parameter. This parameter is generally not explicitly present in languages which natively support interfaces, but is shown in the C style "Vtbl" definition.</p>
      <p>Passing an invalid pointer may cause undefined behaviour, including (but not limited to) program termination.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Type1, Arg1</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>Each of these pairs represents a single parameter to be passed to the method. The number of pairs is unlimited. For <em>Type</em>, see the <a href="DllCall.htm#types">DllCall types table</a>. For <em>Arg</em>, specify the value to be passed to the method.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>ReturnType</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>If omitted, the return type defaults to <a href="DllCall.htm#HRESULT">HRESULT</a>, which is most the common return type for COM interface methods. Any result indicating failure causes an <a href="Error.htm#OSError">OSError</a> to be thrown; therefore, the return type must not be omitted unless the actual return type is HRESULT.</p>
      <p>If the method is of a type that does not return a value (the <code>void</code> return type in C), specify "Int" or any other numeric type without any suffix (except HRESULT), and ignore the return value. As the content of the return value register is arbitrary in such cases, an exception may or may not be thrown if <em>ReturnType</em> is omitted.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, specify one of the argument types from the <a href="DllCall.htm#types">DllCall types table</a>. The <a href="DllCall.htm#asterisk">asterisk suffix</a> is also supported.</p>
      <p id="cdecl">Although ComCall supports the <em>Cdecl</em> keyword as per <a href="DllCall.htm#cdecl">DllCall</a>, it is generally not used by COM interface methods.</p>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>

<p>Otherwise, ComCall returns the actual value returned by the method. If the method is of a type that does not return a value (with return type defined in C as <code>void</code>), the result is undefined and should be ignored.</p>

<h1>ComObjArray</h1>

<p>Creates a SafeArray for use with COM.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">ArrayObj := <span class="func">ComObjArray</span>(VarType, Count1 <span class="optional">, Count2, ... Count8</span>)</pre>
<p><code>ComObjArray</code> itself is a <a href="Class.htm">class</a> derived from <code>ComValue</code>, but is used only to create or identify SafeArray wrapper objects.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>VarType</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    The base type of the array (the VARTYPE of each element of the array). The VARTYPE is restricted to a subset of the variant types. Neither the VT_ARRAY nor the VT_BYREF flag can be set. VT_EMPTY and VT_NULL are not valid base types for the array. All other types are legal.
    <p>See <a href="ComObjType.htm">ComObjType</a> for a list of possible values.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Count<i>N</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The size of each dimension. Arrays containing up to 8 dimensions are supported.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: ComObjArray</p>
<p>This function returns a wrapper object containing a new SafeArray.</p>

<h2 id="Methods">Methods</h2>
<p>ComObjArray objects support the following methods:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>.MaxIndex(n)</code>: Returns the upper bound of the <i>n</i>th dimension. If <i>n</i> is omitted, it defaults to 1.</li>
    <li><code>.MinIndex(n)</code>: Returns the lower bound of the <i>n</i>th dimension. If <i>n</i> is omitted, it defaults to 1.</li>
    <li><code>.Clone()</code>: Returns a copy of the array.</li>
    <li><code>.__Enum()</code>: Not typically called by script; allows <a href="For.htm">for-loops</a> to be used with SafeArrays.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are currently hard-coded; they do not exist as properties and are not affected by modifications to <code>ComObjArray.Prototype</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>ComObjArray objects may also be returned by COM methods and <a href="ComValue.htm">ComValue</a>. Scripts may determine if a value is a ComObjArray as follows:</p>
<pre><em>; Check class</em>
if obj is ComObjArray
    MsgBox "Array subtype: " . ComObjType(obj) &amp; 0xfff
else
    MsgBox "Not an array."

<em>; Check for VT_ARRAY</em>
if ComObjType(obj) &amp; 0x2000
    MsgBox "obj is a ComObjArray"

<em>; Check specific array type</em>
if ComObjType(obj) = 0x2008
    MsgBox "obj is a ComObjArray of strings"</pre>
<p>Arrays with up to 8 dimensions are supported.</p>
<p>Since SafeArrays are not designed to support multiple references, when one SafeArray is assigned to an element of another SafeArray, a separate copy is created. However, this only occurs if the wrapper object has the F_OWNVALUE flag, which indicates it is responsible for destroying the array. This flag can be removed by using <a href="ComObjFlags.htm">ComObjFlags</a>.</p>
<p>When a function or method called by a COM client returns a SafeArray with the F_OWNVALUE flag, a copy is created and returned instead, as the original SafeArray is automatically destroyed.</p>

<h1>ComObjConnect</h1>
<p>Connects a COM object's event source to the script, enabling events to be handled.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">ComObjConnect</span> ComObj <span class="optional">, PrefixOrSink</span></pre>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>ComObj</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="ComObject.htm">ComObject</a></p>
    <p>An object which raises events.</p>
    <p>If the object does not support the IConnectionPointContainer interface or type information about the object's class cannot be retrieved, an error message is shown. This can be suppressed or handled with <a href="Try.htm">try</a>/<a href="Catch.htm">catch</a>.</p>
    <p>The IProvideClassInfo interface is used to retrieve type information about the object's class if the object supports it. Otherwise, ComObjConnect attempts to retrieve type information via the object's IDispatch interface, which may be unreliable.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>PrefixOrSink</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../Objects.htm">Object</a></p>
      <p>A string to prefix to the event name to determine which global function to call when an event occurs, or an <a href="#event-sink">event sink object</a> defining a static method for each event to be handled.</p>
      <p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Nested functions are not supported in this mode, as names may be resolved after the current function returns. To use nested functions or closures, attach them to an object and pass the object as described below.</p>
      <p>If omitted, the object is "disconnected"; that is, the script will no longer receive notification of its events.</p>
    </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To make effective use of ComObjConnect, you must first write functions in the script to handle any events of interest. Such functions, or "event-handlers," have the following structure:</p>
<pre class="Syntax Short NoIndent"><i>Prefix</i><b>EventName</b>([<i>Params...</i>, ComObj])
{
    <i class="dull">... event-handling code ...</i>
    return <i>ReturnValue</i>
}</pre>
<p><i>Prefix</i> should be the same as the <em>PrefixOrSink</em> parameter if it is a string; otherwise, it should be omitted. <b>EventName</b> should be replaced with the name of whatever event the function should handle.</p>
<p><i>Params</i> corresponds to whatever parameters the event has. If the event has no parameters, <i>Params</i> should be omitted entirely. <i>ComObj</i> is an additional parameter containing a reference to the original wrapper object which was passed to ComObjConnect; it is never included in the COM event's documentation. "ComObj" should be replaced with a name more meaningful in the context of your script.</p>
<p>Note that event handlers may have return values. To return a COM-specific type of value, use <a href="ComValue.htm">ComValue</a>. For example, <code>return ComValue(0,0)</code> returns a variant of type VT_EMPTY, which is equivalent to returning <code>undefined</code> (or not returning) from a JavaScript function.</p>
<p>Call <code>ComObjConnect(yourObject, "<i>Prefix</i>")</code> to enable event-handling.</p>
<p>Call <code>ComObjConnect(yourObject)</code> to disconnect the object (stop handling events).</p>
<p>If the number of parameters is not known, a <a href="../Functions.htm#Variadic">variadic function</a> can be used.</p>

<h3 id="event-sink">Event Sink</h3>
<p>If <em>PrefixOrSink</em> is an object, whenever an event is raised, the corresponding method of that object is called. Although the object can be constructed dynamically, it is more typical for <em>PrefixOrSink</em> to refer to a class or an instance of a class. In that case, methods are defined as shown above, but without <em>Prefix</em>.</p>
<p>As with any call to a method, the method's (normally hidden) <code>this</code> parameter contains a reference to the object through which the method was called; i.e. the event sink object, not the COM object. This can be used to provide context to the event handlers, or share values between them.</p>
<p>To catch all events without defining a method for each one, define a <a href="../Objects.htm#Meta_Functions">__Call meta-function</a>.</p>
<p><em>ComObject</em> releases its reference to <em>PrefixOrSink</em> automatically if the COM object releases the connection. For example, Internet Explorer does this when it exits. If the script does not retain its own reference to <em>PrefixOrSink</em>, it can use <a href="../Objects.htm#Custom_NewDelete">__Delete</a> to detect when this occurs. If the object is hosted by a remote process and the process terminates unexpectedly, it may take several minutes for the system to release the connection.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The script must retain a reference to <em>ComObj</em>, otherwise it would be freed automatically and would disconnect from its COM object, preventing any further events from being detected. There is no standard way to detect when the connection is no longer required, so the script must disconnect manually by calling ComObjConnect.</p>
<p>The <a href="Persistent.htm">Persistent</a> function may be needed to keep the script running while it is listening for events.</p>
<p>An exception is thrown on failure.</p>

<p>The wrapper object assumes responsibility for automatically releasing the pointer when appropriate. This function <a href="ComObjQuery.htm">queries</a> the object for its IDispatch interface; if one is returned, <em>DispPtr</em> is immediately released. Therefore, if the script intends to use the pointer after calling this function, it must call <code><a href="ObjAddRef.htm">ObjAddRef</a>(DispPtr)</code> first.</p>
<p><b>Known limitation:</b> Each time a COM object is wrapped, a new wrapper object is created. Comparisons and assignments such as <code>obj1 == obj2</code> and <code>array[obj1] := value</code> treat the two wrapper objects as unique, even when they contain the same COM object.</p>

<h2 id="General_Remarks">General Remarks</h2>
<p>In most common cases, return values from methods or properties of COM objects are converted to an appropriate data type supported by AutoHotkey. Types which aren't specifically handled are coerced to strings via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-variantchangetype">VariantChangeType</a>; if this fails or if the variant type contains the VT_ARRAY or VT_BYREF flag, an object containing both the value and its type is returned instead.</p>
<p>For any variable <i>x</i>, if <code>ComObjType(x)</code> returns an integer, <i>x</i> contains a COM object wrapper.</p>
<p>If <em>Param2</em> is <code>"Name"</code> or <code>"IID"</code>, type information is retrieved via the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/oaidl/nf-oaidl-idispatch-gettypeinfo">IDispatch::GetTypeInfo</a> interface method. <em>ComObj</em>'s variant type must be VT_DISPATCH.</p>
<p>If <em>Param2</em> is <code>"Class"</code> or <code>"CLSID"</code>, type information is retrieved via the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/ocidl/nf-ocidl-iprovideclassinfo-getclassinfo">IProvideClassInfo::GetClassInfo</a> interface method. <em>ComObj</em>'s variant type must be VT_DISPATCH or VT_UNKNOWN, and the object must implement the IProvideClassInfo interface (some objects do not).</p>

<h2 id="Returns">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: ComValue, ComValueRef, <a href="ComObjArray.htm">ComObjArray</a> or <a href="ComObject.htm">ComObject</a></p>
<p>Returns a wrapper object containing a <a href="ComObjType.htm#vt">variant type</a> and value or pointer.</p>
<p>This object has multiple uses:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Some COM methods may require specific types of values which have no direct equivalent within AutoHotkey. This function allows the type of a value to be specified when passing it to a COM method. For example, <code>ComValue(0xB, true)</code> creates an object which represents the COM boolean value <em>true</em>.</li>
  <li>Wrapping a COM object or SafeArray enables the script to interact with it more naturally, using <a href="../Objects.htm#Usage_Objects">object syntax</a>. However, the majority of scripts do not need to do this manually since a wrapper object is created automatically by <a href="ComObject.htm">ComObject</a>, <a href="ComObjArray.htm">ComObjArray</a>, <a href="ComObjActive.htm">ComObjActive</a>, <a href="ComObjGet.htm">ComObjGet</a> and any COM method which returns an object.</li>
  <li>Wrapping a COM interface pointer allows the script to take advantage of automatic reference counting. An interface pointer can be wrapped immediately upon being returned to the script (typically from <a href="ComCall.htm">ComCall</a> or <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>), avoiding the need to explicitly <a href="ObjAddRef.htm">release</a> it at some later point.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Ptr">Ptr</h2>
<p>If a wrapper object's <a href="ComObjType.htm#vt"><em>VarType</em></a> is VT_UNKNOWN (13) or includes the VT_BYREF (0x4000) flag or VT_ARRAY (0x2000) flag, the <code>Ptr</code> property can be used to retrieve the address of the object, typed variable or SafeArray. This allows the ComObject itself to be passed to any <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> or <a href="ComCall.htm">ComCall</a> parameter which has the <code>"Ptr"</code> type, but can also be used explicitly. For example, <code>ComObj.Ptr</code> is equivalent to <code>ComObjValue(ComObj)</code> in these cases.</p>
<p>If a wrapper object's <a href="ComObjType.htm#vt"><em>VarType</em></a> is VT_UNKNOWN (13) or VT_DISPATCH (9) and the wrapped pointer is null (0), the <code>Ptr</code> property can be used to retrieve the current null value or to assign a pointer to the wrapper object. Once assigned (if non-null), the pointer will be released automatically when the wrapper object is freed. This can be used with <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> or <a href="ComCall.htm">ComCall</a> output parameters of type <code>"Ptr*"</code> or <code>"PtrP"</code> to ensure the pointer will be released automatically, such as if an error occurs. For an example, see <a href="ComObjQuery.htm#ExIE">ComObjQuery</a>.</p>
<p>When a wrapper object with <em>VarType</em> VT_DISPATCH (9) and a null (0) pointer value is assigned a non-null pointer value, its type changes from <code>ComValue</code> to <code>ComObject</code>. The properties and methods of the wrapped object become available and the <code>Ptr</code> property becomes unavailable.</p>

<h2 id="ByRef">ByRef</h2>
<p>If a wrapper object's <a href="ComObjType.htm#vt"><em>VarType</em></a> includes the VT_BYREF (0x4000) flag, empty brackets <code>[]</code> can be used to read or write the referenced value.</p>
<p>When creating a reference, <em>Value</em> must be the memory address of a variable or buffer with sufficient capacity to store a value of the given type. For example, the following can be used to create a variable which a VBScript function can write into:</p>
<pre>vbuf := Buffer(24, 0)
vref := ComValue(0x400C, vbuf.ptr)  <em>; 0x400C is a combination of VT_BYREF and VT_VARIANT.</em>

vref[] := "in value"
sc.Run("Example", vref)  <em>; sc should be initialized as in the <a href="#ExByRef">example below</a>.</em>
MsgBox vref[]</pre>
<p>Note that although any previous value is freed when a new value is assigned by <code>vref[]</code> or the COM method, the final value is not freed automatically. Freeing the value requires knowing which type it is. Because it is VT_VARIANT in this case, it can be freed by calling <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/oleauto/nf-oleauto-variantclear">VariantClear</a> with <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> or by using a simpler method: assign an integer, such as <code>vref[] := 0</code>.</p>
<p>If the method accepts a combination of VT_BYREF and VT_VARIANT as shown above, a <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a> can be used instead. For example:</p>
<pre>some_var := "in value"
sc.Run("Example", &amp;some_var)
MsgBox some_var</pre>
<p>However, some methods require a more specific variant type, such as <code>VT_BYREF | VT_I4</code>. In such cases, the first approach shown above must be used, replacing 0x400C with the appropriate variant type.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">General Remarks</h2>
<p>When this function is used to wrap an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winauto/idispatch-interface">IDispatch</a> or IUnknown interface pointer (passed as an integer), the wrapper object assumes responsibility for automatically releasing the pointer when appropriate. Therefore, if the script intends to use the pointer after calling this function, it must call <code><a href="ObjAddRef.htm">ObjAddRef</a>(DispPtr)</code> first. By contrast, this is not necessary if <em>Value</em> is itself a ComValue or ComObject.</p>
<p>Conversion from VT_UNKNOWN to VT_DISPATCH results in a call to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(refiid_void)">IUnknown::QueryInterface</a>, which may produce an interface pointer different to the original, and will throw an exception if the object does not implement IDispatch. By contrast, if <em>Value</em> is an integer and <em>VarType</em> is VT_DISPATCH, the value is used directly, and therefore must be an IDispatch-compatible interface pointer.</p>
<p>The <em>VarType</em> of a wrapper object can be retrieved using <a href="ComObjType.htm">ComObjType</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Value</em> of a wrapper object can be retrieved using <a href="ComObjValue.htm">ComObjValue</a>.</p>
<p><b>Known limitation:</b> Each time a COM object is wrapped, a new wrapper object is created. Comparisons and assignments such as <code>obj1 == obj2</code> and <code>array[obj1] := value</code> treat the two wrapper objects as unique, even when they contain the same variant type and value.</p>

<h2 id="Parameter">The <em>Control</em> Parameter</h2>
<p>Functions which operate on individual controls have a parameter named <em>Control</em> which supports a few different ways to identify the control. The <em>Control</em> parameter can be one of the following:</p>
<p><strong>ClassNN</strong> (<a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a>): The ClassNN (classname and instance number) of the control, which can be determined via Window Spy. For example "Edit1" is the first control with classname "Edit".</p>
<p><strong>Text</strong> (<a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a>): The control's text. The matching behavior is determined by <a href="SetTitleMatchMode.htm">SetTitleMatchMode</a>.</p>
<p><strong>HWND</strong> (<a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a>): The control's HWND, which is typically retrieved via <a href="ControlGetHwnd.htm">ControlGetHwnd</a>, <a href="MouseGetPos.htm">MouseGetPos</a>, or <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>. This also works on hidden controls even when <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> is Off. Any subsequent window parameters are ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Object</strong>: An object of any type with a <code>Hwnd</code> property, such as a <a href="GuiControl.htm">GuiControl</a>. A <a href="Error.htm#PropertyError">PropertyError</a> is thrown if the object has no <code>Hwnd</code> property, or <a href="Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a> if it does not return a pure integer. Any subsequent window parameters are ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Omitted</strong>: A few functions are able to operate on either a control or a top-level window. Omitting the <em>Control</em> parameter causes the function to use the target window (specified by <em><a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm">WinTitle</a></em>) instead of one of its controls. For example, <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a> can send keyboard messages directly to the window.</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>Typically one of the following errors may be thrown:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Error.htm#TargetError">TargetError</a>: The target window or control could not be found.</li>
  <li><a href="Error.htm">Error</a> or <a href="Error.htm#OSError">OSError</a>: There was a problem carring out the function's purpose, such as retrieving a setting or applying a change.</li>
  <li><a href="Error.htm#ValueError">ValueError</a> or <a href="Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a>: Invalid parameters were detected.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>To improve reliability, a delay is done automatically after each use of a Control function that changes a control (except for <a href="ControlSetStyle.htm">ControlSetStyle</a> and <a href="ControlSetStyle.htm">ControlSetExStyle</a>). That delay can be changed via <a href="SetControlDelay.htm">SetControlDelay</a> or by assigning a value to <a href="../Variables.htm#ControlDelay">A_ControlDelay</a>. For details, see <a href="SetControlDelay.htm#Remarks">SetControlDelay remarks</a>.</p>
<p>To discover the ClassNN or HWND of the control that the mouse is currently hovering over, use <a href="MouseGetPos.htm">MouseGetPos</a>.</p>
<p>To retrieve a list of all controls in a window, use <a href="WinGetControls.htm">WinGetControls</a> or <a href="WinGetControlsHwnd.htm">WinGetControlsHwnd</a>.</p>
<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>

      <p>If this parameter is omitted, the target window itself will be clicked. Otherwise, one of the two modes below will be used.</p>
      <p>Mode 1 (Position): Specify the X and Y coordinates relative to the upper left corner of the target window's <a href="CoordMode.htm#Client">client area</a>. The X coordinate must precede the Y coordinate and there must be at least one space or tab between them. For example: <code>X55 Y33</code>. If there is a control at the specified coordinates, it will be sent the click-event at those exact coordinates. If there is no control, the target window itself will be sent the event (which might have no effect depending on the nature of the window).</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In mode 1, the X and Y option letters of the <em>Options</em> parameter are ignored.</p>
      <p>Mode 2 (Control): Specify the control's ClassNN, text or HWND, or an object with a <code>Hwnd</code> property. For details, see <a href="Control.htm#Parameter">The Control Parameter</a>.</p>
      <p>By default, mode 2 takes precedence over mode 1. For example, in the unlikely event that there is a control whose text or ClassNN has the format "Xnnn Ynnn", it would be acted upon by Mode 2. To override this and use mode 1 unconditionally, specify the word Pos in <em>Options</em> as in the following example: <code>ControlClick "x255 y152", WinTitle,,,, "Pos"</code>.</p>

      <p><strong>D</strong>: Press the mouse button down but do not release it (i.e. generate a down-event). If both the <strong>D</strong> and <strong>U</strong> options are absent, a complete click (down and up) will be sent.</p>

      <p><strong>Pos</strong>: Specify the word Pos anywhere in <em>Options</em> to unconditionally use the X/Y positioning mode as described in the <em>Control-or-Pos</em> parameter above.</p>
      <p><strong>Xn</strong>: Specify for <strong>n</strong> the X position to click at, relative to the control's upper left corner. If unspecified, the click will occur at the horizontal-center of the control.</p>
      <p><strong>Yn</strong>: Specify for <strong>n</strong> the Y position to click at, relative to the control's upper left corner. If unspecified, the click will occur at the vertical-center of the control.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="Reliability">Reliability</h2>
<p>To improve reliability -- especially during times when the user is physically moving the mouse during the ControlClick -- one or both of the following may help:</p>
<p>1) Use <code><a href="SetControlDelay.htm">SetControlDelay</a> -1</code> prior to ControlClick. This avoids holding the mouse button down during the click, which in turn reduces interference from the user's physical movement of the mouse.</p>
<p>2) Specify the string NA anywhere in the sixth parameter (<em>Options</em>) as shown below:</p>
<pre>SetControlDelay -1
ControlClick "Toolbar321", WinTitle,,,, "NA"</pre>
<p><code>NA</code> avoids marking the target window as active and avoids merging its input processing with that of the script, which may prevent physical movement of the mouse from interfering (but usually only when the target window is not active). However, this method might not work for all types of windows and controls.</p>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Not all applications obey a <em>ClickCount</em> higher than 1 for turning the mouse wheel. For those applications, use a Loop to turn the wheel more than one notch as in this example, which turns it 5 notches:</p>
<pre>Loop 5
    ControlClick <i>Control</i>, <i>WinTitle</i>, <i>WinText</i>, "WheelUp"</pre>

<p>To be effective, the control's window generally must not be minimized or hidden.</p>
<p>To improve reliability, a delay is done automatically after every use of this function. That delay can be changed via <a href="SetControlDelay.htm">SetControlDelay</a>.</p>
<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>
<p id="WM_NEXTDLGCTL">When a control is focused in response to user input (such as pressing the Tab key), the dialog manager applies additional effects which are independent of the control having focus. These effects are not applied by ControlFocus, and therefore the following limitations apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Focusing a button does not automatically make it the default button, as would normally happen if a button is focused by user input. The default button can usually be activated by pressing Enter.</li>
  <li>If user input previously caused the default button to be temporarily changed, focusing a non-button control does not automatically restore the default highlight to the actual default button. Pressing Enter may then activate the default button even though it is not highlighted.</li>
  <li>Focusing an edit control does not automatically select its text. Instead, the insertion point (caret) is typically positioned wherever it was last time the control had focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/dlgbox/wm-nextdlgctl">WM_NEXTDLGCTL</a> message can be used to focus the control and apply these additional effects. For example:</p>
<pre>WinExist("A") <em>; Set the Last Found Window to the active window</em>
ControlGet, hWndControl, Hwnd,, Button1  <em>; Get HWND of first Button</em>
SendMessage, 0x0028, hWndControl, True  <em>; 0x0028 is WM_NEXTDLGCTL</em></pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To retrieve text from a ListView, ListBox, or ComboBox, use <a href="ListViewGetContent.htm">ListViewGetContent</a> or <a href="ControlGetItems.htm">ControlGetItems</a> instead.</p>
<p>If the retrieved text appears to be truncated (incomplete), it may be necessary to retrieve the text by sending the WM_GETTEXT message via <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> instead. This is because some applications do not respond properly to the WM_GETTEXTLENGTH message, which causes AutoHotkey to make the return value too small to fit all the text.</p>
<p>This function might use a large amount of RAM if the target control (e.g. an editor with a large document open) contains a large quantity of text. However, a variable's memory can be freed after use by assigning it to nothing, i.e. <code>Text := ""</code>.</p>
<p>Text retrieved from most control types uses carriage return and linefeed (`r`n) rather than a solitary linefeed (`n) to mark the end of each line.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to do <code>SetTitleMatchMode "Slow"</code> because ControlGetText always retrieves the text using the slow method (since it works on a broader range of control types).</p>
<p>To retrieve a list of all controls in a window, use <a href="WinGetControls.htm">WinGetControls</a> or <a href="WinGetControlsHwnd.htm">WinGetControlsHwnd</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#TargetError">TargetError</a> is thrown if the window or control could not be found.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>ControlSendText sends the individual characters of the <em>Keys</em> parameter without translating <code>{Enter}</code> to <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <code>^c</code> to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, etc. For details, see <a href="Send.htm#SendText">Text mode</a>. It is also valid to use <a href="Send.htm#Raw">{Raw}</a> or <a href="Send.htm#Text">{Text}</a> with ControlSend.</p>
<p>If the <em>Control</em> parameter is omitted, this function will attempt to send directly to the target window by sending to its topmost control (which is often the correct one) or the window itself if there are no controls. This is useful if a window does not appear to have any controls at all, or just for the convenience of not having to worry about which control to send to.</p>
<p>By default, modifier keystrokes (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and Win) are sent as they normally would be by the Send function. This allows command prompt and other console windows to properly detect uppercase letters, control characters, etc. It may also improve reliability in other ways.</p>
<p>However, in some cases these modifier events may interfere with the active window, especially if the user is actively typing during a ControlSend or if <kbd>Alt</kbd> is being sent (since <kbd>Alt</kbd> activates the active window's menu bar). This can be avoided by explicitly sending modifier up and down events as in this example:</p>
<pre>ControlSend "{Alt down}f{Alt up}", "Edit1", "Untitled - Notepad"</pre>
<p>The method above also allows the sending of modifier keystrokes (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and Win) while the workstation is locked (protected by logon prompt).</p>
<p><a href="BlockInput.htm">BlockInput</a> should be avoided when using ControlSend against a console window such as command prompt. This is because it might prevent capitalization and modifier keys such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> from working properly.</p>
<p>The value of <a href="SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a> determines the speed at which keys are sent. If the target window does not receive the keystrokes reliably, try increasing the press duration via the second parameter of <a href="SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a> as in these examples:</p>
<pre>SetKeyDelay 10, 10
SetKeyDelay 0, 10
SetKeyDelay -1, 0</pre>
<p>If the target control is an Edit control (or something similar), the following are usually more reliable and faster than ControlSend:</p>
<pre><a href="EditPaste.htm">EditPaste</a>("This text will be inserted at the caret position.", ControlName, WinTitle)</pre>
<pre><a href="ControlSetText.htm">ControlSetText</a>("This text will entirely replace any current text.", ControlName, WinTitle)</pre>
<p>ControlSend is generally not capable of manipulating a window's menu bar. To work around this, use <a href="MenuSelect.htm">MenuSelect</a>. If that is not possible due to the nature of the menu bar, you could try to discover the message that corresponds to the desired menu item by following the <a href="../misc/SendMessage.htm">SendMessage Tutorial</a>.</p>

<h1>Critical</h1>

<p>Prevents the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> from being interrupted by other threads, or enables it to be interrupted.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">
<span class="func">Critical</span> <span class="optional">OnOffNumeric</span></pre>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>OnOffNumeric</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If blank or omitted, it defaults to On. Otherwise, specify one of the following:</p>
    <p><strong>On</strong>: The <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> is made critical, meaning that it cannot be interrupted by another thread.</p>
    <p><strong>Off</strong>: The current thread immediately becomes interruptible, regardless of the settings of <a href="Thread.htm">Thread Interrupt</a>. See <a href="#Off">Critical Off</a> for details.</p>
    <p><strong>(Numeric)</strong>: Specify a positive number to turn on Critical but also change the number of milliseconds between checks of the internal message queue. See <a href="#Interval">Message Check Interval</a> for details. Specifying 0 turns off Critical. Specifying -1 turns on Critical but disables message checks.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>This function returns the previous setting (the value <a href="../Variables.htm#IsCritical">A_IsCritical</a> would return prior to calling the function).</p>

<h2 id="Behave">Behavior of Critical Threads</h2>
<p>Critical threads are <em>uninterruptible</em>; for details, see <a href="../misc/Threads.htm#Behave">Threads</a>.</p>
<p>A critical thread becomes interruptible when a <a href="MsgBox.htm">message box</a> or other dialog is displayed. However, unlike <a href="Thread.htm">Thread Interrupt</a>, the thread becomes critical again after the user dismisses the dialog.</p>

<h2 id="Off">Critical Off</h2>
<p>When buffered events are waiting to start new threads, using <code>Critical "Off"</code> will not result in an immediate interruption of the current thread. Instead, an average of 5 milliseconds will pass before an interruption occurs. This makes it more than 99.999% likely that at least one line after <code>Critical "Off"</code> will execute before an interruption. You can force interruptions to occur immediately by means of a delay such as a <code><a href="Sleep.htm">Sleep</a> -1</code> or a <a href="WinWait.htm">WinWait</a> for a window that does not yet exist.</p>
<p><code>Critical "Off"</code> cancels the current thread's period of uninterruptibility even if the thread was not Critical, thereby letting events such as <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Size">Size</a> be processed sooner or more predictably.</p>

<h2 id="Settings">Thread Settings</h2>
<p>See <a href="../Variables.htm#IsCritical">A_IsCritical</a> for how to save and restore the current setting of Critical. However, since Critical is a thread-specific setting, when a critical thread ends, the underlying/resumed thread (if any) will  be automatically noncritical. Consequently there is no need to do <code>Critical "Off"</code> right before ending a thread.</p>
<p>If Critical is not used by <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">the auto-execute thread</a>, all threads start off as noncritical (though the settings of <code><a href="Thread.htm">Thread</a> "Interrupt"</code> will still apply). By contrast, if the auto-execute thread turns on Critical but never turns it off, every newly launched <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> (such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timed</a> subroutine) starts off critical.</p>
<p>The function <a href="Thread.htm">Thread "NoTimers"</a> is similar to Critical except that it only prevents interruptions from <a href="SetTimer.htm">timers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Interval">Message Check Interval</h2>
<p>Specifying a positive number as the first parameter (e.g. <code>Critical 30</code>) turns on Critical but also changes the minimum number of milliseconds between checks of the internal message queue. If unspecified, the default is 16 milliseconds while Critical is On, and 5 ms while Critical is Off. Increasing the interval postpones the arrival of messages/events, which gives the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> more time to finish. This reduces the possibility that certain <a href="OnMessage.htm">OnMessage()</a> and <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm">GUI events</a> will be lost due to "thread already running". However, functions that wait such as <a href="Sleep.htm">Sleep</a> and <a href="WinWait.htm">WinWait</a> will check messages regardless of this setting (a workaround is <code>DllCall("Sleep", "UInt", 500)</code>).</p>
<p>This setting affects the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Preemptive message checks, which potentially occur before each line of code executes.</li>
  <li>Periodic message checks during <a href="Send.htm">Send</a>, file and download operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not affect the frequency of message checks while the script is paused or waiting.</p>
<p>Because the system tick count generally has a granularity of 15.6 milliseconds, the minimum delta value is generally at least 15 or 16. The duration since the last check must <em>exceed</em> the interval setting in order for another check to occur. For example, a setting of 16 requires the tick count to change by 17 or greater. As a message check could occur at any time within the 15.6 millisecond window, any setting between 1 and 16 could permit two message checks within a single interval.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Increasing the message-check interval too much may reduce the responsiveness of various events such as <a href="Gui.htm">GUI</a> window repainting.</p>
<p><code>Critical -1</code> turns on Critical but disables message checks. This does not prevent the program from checking for messages while performing a sleep, delay or wait. It is useful in cases where dispatching messages could interfere with the code currently executing, such as while handling certain types of messages during an <a href="OnMessage.htm">OnMessage</a> callback.</p>

Use Window Spy to determine which text of the currently-active window is hidden. All built-in functions that accept a <em>WinText</em> parameter are affected by this setting, including <a href="WinActivate.htm">WinActivate</a>, <a href="WinActive.htm">WinActive</a>, <a href="WinWait.htm">WinWait</a>, and <a href="WinExist.htm">WinExist</a>.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_DetectHiddenText</strong> contains the current setting (1 or 0).</p>
<p>Every newly launched <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> (such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timed</a> subroutine) starts off fresh with the default setting for this function. That default may be changed by using this function during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>.</p>

    <p><code>1</code> or <code>True</code>: Hidden windows are detected.</p>
    <p><code>0</code> or <code>False</code>: This is the default. Hidden windows are not detected, except by the <a href="WinShow.htm">WinShow</a> function.</p>

<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">Boolean</a></p>
<p>This function returns the previous setting.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Turning on DetectHiddenWindows can make scripting harder in some cases since some hidden system windows might accidentally match the title or text of another window you're trying to work with. So most scripts should leave this setting turned off. However, turning it on may be useful if you wish to work with hidden windows directly without first using <a href="WinShow.htm">WinShow</a> to unhide them.</p>
<p>All windowing functions except <a href="WinShow.htm">WinShow</a> are affected by this setting, including <a href="WinActivate.htm">WinActivate</a>, <a href="WinActive.htm">WinActive</a>, <a href="WinWait.htm">WinWait</a> and <a href="WinExist.htm">WinExist</a>. By contrast, <a href="WinShow.htm">WinShow</a> will always unhide a hidden window even if hidden windows are not being detected.</p>
<p>Turning on DetectHiddenWindows is not necessary in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When using a <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_id">pure HWND</a>, as in <code>WinShow(A_ScriptHwnd)</code>.</li>
  <li>When using an <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_id">object with a Hwnd property</a> (such as a <a href="Gui.htm">Gui</a>), as in <code>WinMoveTop(myGui)</code>.</li>
  <li>When accessing a control or child window via the <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_id">ahk_id method</a> or as the <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow">last-found-window</a>.</li>
  <li>When accessing GUI windows via the <a href="Gui.htm#LastFound">+LastFound</a> option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloaked windows are also considered hidden. Cloaked windows, introduced with Windows 8, are windows on a non-active virtual desktop or UWP apps which have been suspended to improve performance, or more precisely to reduce their memory consumption. On Windows 10, the processes of those are indicated with a green leaf in the Task Manager. Such windows are hidden from view, but might still have the WS_VISIBLE window style.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_DetectHiddenWindows</strong> contains the current setting (1 or 0).</p>
<p>Every newly launched <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> (such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timed</a> subroutine) starts off fresh with the default setting for this function.

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>If the destination directory structure doesn't exist it will be created if possible.</p>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>This function returns the attributes of the first matching folder. This string is a subset of <code>RASHDOC</code>, where each letter means the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>R = READONLY</li>
    <li>A = ARCHIVE</li>
    <li>S = SYSTEM</li>
    <li>H = HIDDEN</li>
    <li>D = DIRECTORY</li>
    <li>O = OFFLINE</li>
    <li>C = COMPRESSED</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this function only checks for the existence of a folder, "D" is always present in the return value. If no folder is found, an empty string is returned.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Note that searches such as <code>DirExist("FolderWithFilesAndSubfolders\*")</code> only tells you whether a folder exists. If you want to check for the existence of files <em>and</em> folders, use <a href="FileExist.htm">FileExist</a> instead.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="FileGetAttrib.htm">FileGetAttrib</a>, DirExist supports wildcard patterns and always returns a non-empty value if a matching folder exists.</p>
<p>Since an empty string is seen as "false", the function's return value can always be used as a quasi-boolean value. For example, the statement <code>if DirExist("C:\MyFolder")</code> would be true if the folder exists and false otherwise.</p>
<p>Since <em>FilePattern</em> may contain wildcards, DirExist may be unsuitable for validating a folder path which is to be used with another function or program. For example, <code>DirExist("Program*")</code> may return attributes even though "Program*" is not a valid folder name. In such cases, <a href="FileGetAttrib.htm">FileGetAttrib</a> is preferred.</p>

      <p>If blank or omitted, the dialog's initial selection will be the user's My Documents folder (or possibly My Computer). A <a href="../misc/CLSID-List.htm">CLSID folder</a> such as <code>"::{20d04fe0-3aea-1069-a2d8-08002b30309d}"</code> (i.e. My Computer) may be specified start navigation at a specific special folder.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the most common usage of this parameter is an asterisk followed immediately by the absolute path of the drive or folder to be initially selected. For example, <code>"*C:\"</code> would initially select the C drive. Similarly, <code>"*C:\My Folder"</code> would initially select that particular folder.</p>
      <p>The asterisk indicates that the user is permitted to navigate upward (closer to the root) from the starting folder. Without the asterisk, the user would be forced to select a folder inside <em>StartingFolder</em> (or <em>StartingFolder</em> itself). One benefit of omitting the asterisk is that <em>StartingFolder</em> is initially shown in a tree-expanded state, which may save the user from having to click the first plus sign.</p>
      <p>If the asterisk is present, upward navigation may optionally be restricted to a folder other than Desktop. This is done by preceding the asterisk with the absolute path of the uppermost folder followed by exactly one space or tab. For example, <code>"C:\My Folder *C:\My Folder\Projects"</code> would not allow the user to navigate any higher than C:\My Folder (but the initial selection would be C:\My Folder\Projects).</p>

      <p><strong>1</strong> (default): A button is provided that allows the user to create new folders.</p>
      <p><strong>Add 2</strong> to the above number to  provide an edit field that allows the user to type the name of a folder. For example, a value of 3 for this parameter provides both an edit field and a "make new folder" button.</p>
      <p id="NewDialog"><strong>Add 4</strong> to the above number to omit the BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE property. Adding 4 ensures that DirSelect will work properly even in a Preinstallation Environment like WinPE or BartPE. However, this prevents the appearance of a "make new folder" button.</p>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>This function returns the full path and name of the folder chosen by the user. If the user cancels the dialog (i.e. does not wish to select a folder), an empty string is returned. If the user selects a root directory (such as C:\), the return value will contain a trailing backslash. If this is undesirable, remove it as follows:</p>
<pre>Folder := RegExReplace(DirSelect(), "\\$")  <em>; Removes the trailing backslash, if present.</em></pre>
<p>An empty string is also returned if the system refused to show the dialog, but this is very rare.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A folder-selection dialog usually looks like this:</p>
<img src="../static/dlg_folder.png" alt="DirSelect" />
<p>A GUI window may display a modal folder-selection dialog by means of the <a href="Gui.htm#OwnDialogs">+OwnDialogs</a> option. A modal dialog prevents the user from interacting with the GUI window until the dialog is dismissed.</p>
<p>Known limitation: A <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a> that launches during the display of a DirSelect dialog will postpone the effect of the user's clicks inside the dialog until after the timer finishes. To work around this, avoid using timers whose subroutines take a long time to finish, or disable all timers during the dialog:</p>
<pre><a href="Thread.htm">Thread</a> "NoTimers"
SelectedFolder := DirSelect(, 3)
Thread "NoTimers", false</pre>

<dl>

  <dt>[DllFile\]Function</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
      <p>The DLL or EXE file name followed by a backslash and the name of the function. For example: <code>"MyDLL\MyFunction"</code> (the file extension ".dll" is the default when omitted). If an absolute path isn't specified, <em>DllFile</em> is assumed to be in the system's PATH or <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a>. Note that DllCall expects a path with backslashes (\). Forward slashes (/) are not supported.</p>
      <p id="std"><em>DllFile</em> may be omitted when calling a function that resides in User32.dll, Kernel32.dll, ComCtl32.dll, or Gdi32.dll. For example, <code>"User32\IsWindowVisible"</code> produces the same result as <code>"IsWindowVisible"</code>.</p>
      <p>If no function can be found by the given name, a "W" (Unicode) suffix is automatically appended. For example, <code>"MessageBox"</code> is the same as <code>"MessageBoxW"</code>.</p>
      <p>Performance can be dramatically improved when making <em>repeated</em> calls to a DLL by <a href="#load">loading it beforehand</a>.</p>
      <p>This parameter may also consist solely of an integer, which is interpreted as the address of the function to call. Sources of such addresses include <a href="#COM">COM</a> and <a href="CallbackCreate.htm">CallbackCreate</a>.</p>
      <p>If this parameter is an object, the value of the object's <code>Ptr</code> property is used. If no such property exists, a <a href="Error.htm#PropertyError">PropertyError</a> is thrown.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Type1, Arg1</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>Each of these pairs represents a single parameter to be passed to the function. The number of pairs is unlimited. For <em>Type</em>, see the <a href="#types">types table</a> below. For <em>Arg</em>, specify the value to be passed to the function.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Cdecl ReturnType</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p id="cdecl">The word <em>Cdecl</em> is normally omitted because most functions use the standard calling convention rather than the "C" calling convention (functions such as wsprintf that accept a varying number of arguments are one exception to this). Note that most object-oriented C++ functions use the <i>thiscall</i> convention, which is not supported.</p>
      <p>If present, the word <em>Cdecl</em> should be listed before the return type (if any). Separate each word from the next with a space or tab. For example: <code>"Cdecl Str"</code>.</p>
      <p>Since a separate "C" calling convention does not exist in 64-bit code, <i>Cdecl</i> may be specified but has no effect on 64-bit builds of AutoHotkey.</p>
      <p><em>ReturnType</em>: If the function returns a 32-bit signed integer (Int), BOOL, or nothing at all, <em>ReturnType</em> may be omitted. Otherwise, specify one of the argument types from the <a href="#types">types table</a> below. The <a href="#asterisk">asterisk suffix</a> is also supported.</p>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>DllCall returns the actual value returned by <em>Function</em>. If <em>Function</em> is of a type that does not return a value, the result is an undefined value of the specified return type (integer by default).</p>

<h2 id="types">Types of Arguments and Return Values</h2>
<table class="info">
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th abbr="Descr">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr id="str">
<td>Str</td>
<td>
  <p>A string such as <code>"Blue"</code> or <code>MyVar</code>, or a <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a> such as <code>&amp;MyVar</code>. If the called function modifies the string and the argument is a naked variable or VarRef, its contents will be updated. For example, the following call would convert the contents of <em>MyVar</em> to uppercase: <code>DllCall("CharUpper", "Str", <i>MyVar</i>)</code>.</p>
  <p>If the function is designed to store a string longer than the parameter's input value (or if the parameter is for output only), the recommended approach is to create a <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a>, use the <a href="#ptr">Ptr</a> type to pass it, and use <a href="StrGet.htm">StrGet</a> to retrieve the string after the function returns, as in the <a href="#ExWsprintf">wsprintf example</a>.</p>
  <p>Otherwise, ensure that the variable is large enough before calling the function. This can be achieved by calling <code><a href="VarSetStrCapacity.htm">VarSetStrCapacity</a>(MyVar, 123)</code>, where 123 is the number of 16-bit units (loosely referred to as characters) that <em>MyVar</em> must be able to hold. If the variable is not null-terminated upon return, an error message is shown and the program exits as it is likely that memory has been corrupted via buffer overrun. This would typically indicate that the variable's capacity was insufficient.</p>
  <p>A <em>Str</em> argument must not be an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a> that evaluates to a number (such as <code>i+1</code>). If it is, the function is not called and a <a href="Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a> is thrown.</p>
  <p id="strp">The rarely-used <a href="#asterisk">Str*</a> arg type passes the address of a temporary variable containing the address of the string. If the function writes a new address into the temporary variable, the new string is copied into the script's variable, if a <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a> was passed. This can be used with functions that expect something like "TCHAR **" or "LPTSTR *". However, if the function allocates memory and expects the caller to free it (such as by calling <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cotaskmemfree">CoTaskMemFree</a>), the <code>Ptr*</code> arg type must be used instead.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When passing a string to a function, be aware what <a href="../Compat.htm#DllCall"><i>type</i> of string</a> the function expects.</p></td>

  <td>Since AutoHotkey uses UTF-16 natively, WStr (wide character string) is equivalent to Str.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><span id="astr"></span>AStr</td>
  <td>
    <p>AStr causes the input value to be automatically converted to ANSI. Since the temporary memory used for this conversion is only large enough for the converted input string, any value written to it by the function is discarded. To receive an ANSI string as an output parameter, follow this example:</p>
<pre>buf := Buffer(<i>length</i>)  <em>; Allocate temporary buffer.</em>
DllCall("<i>Function</i>", "ptr", buf)  <em>; Pass buffer to function.</em>
str := StrGet(buf, "cp0")  <em>; Retrieve ANSI string from buffer.</em>
</pre>
    <p>The rarely-used <a href="#asterisk">AStr*</a> arg type is also supported and behaves similarly to the <a href="#strp">Str*</a> type, except that any new string is converted from ANSI to the native format, UTF-16.</p>

If the parameter is a pointer to a single numeric value such as LPDWORD or int*, generally the * or P suffix should be used instead of "Ptr".</p>
  <p>If an object is passed to a Ptr parameter, the value of the object's <code>Ptr</code> property is used. If no such property exists, a <a href="Error.htm#PropertyError">PropertyError</a> is thrown. Typically the object would be a <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a>.</p>
  <p>If an object is passed to a Ptr* parameter, the value of the object's <code>Ptr</code> property is retrieved before the call and the address of a temporary variable containing this value is passed to the function. After the function returns, the new value is assigned back to the object's <code>Ptr</code> property.</p>
  <p><i>Ptr</i> can also be used with the * or P suffix; it should be used with functions that output a pointer via LPVOID* or similar.</p>
  <p><i>UPtr</i> is also valid, but is only unsigned in 32-bit builds as AutoHotkey does not support unsigned 64-bit integers.</p>

    (suffix)</td>
  <td><p>Append an asterisk (with optional preceding space) to any of the above types to cause the address of the argument to be passed rather than the value itself (the called function must be designed to accept it). Since the value of such an argument might be modified by the function, whenever a <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a> is passed as the argument, the variable's contents will be updated after the function returns. For example, the following call would pass the contents of MyVar to MyFunction by address, but would also update MyVar to reflect any changes made to it by MyFunction: <code>DllCall("MyDll\MyFunction", "Int*", &amp;MyVar)</code>.</p>
    <p>In general, an asterisk is used whenever a function has an argument type or return type that starts with "LP". The most common example is LPDWORD, which is a pointer to a DWORD. Since a DWORD is an unsigned 32-bit integer, use "UInt*" or "UIntP" to represent LPDWORD. An asterisk should not be used for string types such as LPTSTR, pointers to structures such as LPRECT, or arrays; for these, <a href="#str">"Str"</a> or <a href="#ptr">"Ptr"</a> should be used, depending on whether you pass a string, address or <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a>.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: "Char*" is not the same as <a href="#str">"Str"</a> because "Char*" passes the address of an 8-bit number, whereas <a href="#str">"Str"</a> passes the address of a series of characters, which may be either 16-bit (Unicode) or 8-bit (for "AStr"), depending on the version of AutoHotkey. Similarly, "UInt*" passes the address of a 32-bit number, so should not be used if the function expects an array of values or a structure larger than 32 bits.</p>
    <p>Since variables in AutoHotkey have no fixed type, the address passed to the function points to temporary memory rather than the caller's variable.</p>

<tr id="unsigned">
  <td>U (prefix)</td>
  <td><p>Prepend the letter U to any of the integer types above to interpret it as an unsigned integer (UInt64, UInt, UShort, and UChar). Strictly speaking, this is necessary only for return values and <a href="#asterisk">asterisk variables</a> because it does not matter whether an argument passed by value is unsigned or signed (except for Int64).</p>
    <p>If a negative integer is specified for an unsigned argument, the integer wraps around into the unsigned domain. For example, when -1 is sent as a UInt, it would become 0xFFFFFFFF.</p>
    <p><em>Unsigned</em> 64-bit integers produced by a function are not supported. Therefore, to work with numbers greater or equal to 0x8000000000000000, omit the U prefix and interpret any negative values received from the function as large integers. For example, a function that yields -1 as an Int64 is really yielding 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF if it is designed to yield a UInt64.</p>

<p>DllCall throws an <a href="Error.htm">Error</a> under any of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Error.htm#OSError">OSError</a>: The <a href="#HRESULT">HRESULT</a> return type was used and the function returned an error value (as defined by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winerror/nf-winerror-failed">FAILED macro</a>). <code>Exception.Extra</code> contains the hexadecimal error code.</li>
  <li><a href="Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a>: The <em>[DllFile\]Function</em> parameter is a floating point number. A string or positive integer is required.</li>
  <li><a href="Error.htm#ValueError">ValueError</a>: The <a href="#types">return type</a> or one of the specified <a href="#types">arg types</a> is invalid.</li>
  <li><a href="Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a>: An argument was passed a value of an unexpected type. For instance, an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a> that evaluates to a number was passed to a string (<a href="#str">str</a>) argument, a non-numeric string was passed to a numeric argument, or an object was passed to an argument <em>not</em> of type <a href="#ptr">Ptr</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="Error.htm">Error</a>: The specified <em>DllFile</em> could not be accessed or loaded. If no explicit path was specified for <em>DllFile</em>, the file must exist in the system's PATH or <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a>. This error might also occur if the user lacks permission to access the file, or if AutoHotkey is 32-bit and the DLL is 64-bit or vice versa.</li>
  <li><a href="Error.htm">Error</a>: The specified function could not be found inside the DLL.</li>
  <li><a href="Error.htm">Error</a>: The function was called but it aborted with a fatal exception. <code>Exception.Extra</code> contains the exception code. For example, 0xC0000005 means "access violation". In such cases, the thread is aborted (if <a href="Try.htm">try</a> is not used), but any <a href="#asterisk">asterisk variables</a> are still updated. An example of a fatal exception is dereferencing an invalid pointer such as NULL (0). Since a <a href="#cdecl">Cdecl</a> function never produces the error described in the next paragraph, it may generate an exception when too few arguments are passed to it.</li>
  <li><a href="Error.htm">Error</a>: The function was called but was passed too many or too few arguments. <code>Exception.Extra</code> contains the number of bytes by which the argument list was incorrect. If it is positive, too many arguments (or arguments that were too large) were passed, or the call requires <a href="#cdecl">CDecl</a>. If it is negative, too few arguments were passed. This situation should be corrected to ensure reliable operation of the function. The presence of this error may also indicate that an exception occurred. Note that due to the x64 calling convention, 64-bit builds never raise this error.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="except">Native Exceptions and A_LastError</h2>
<p>In spite of the built-in exception handling, it is still possible to crash a script with DllCall. This can happen when a function does not directly generate an exception but yields something inappropriate, such as a bad pointer or a string that is not terminated. This might not be the function's fault if the script passed it an unsuitable value such as a bad pointer or a <a href="#str">"str"</a> with insufficient capacity. A script can also crash when it specifies an inappropriate argument type or return type, such as claiming that an ordinary integer yielded by a function is an <a href="#asterisk">asterisk variable</a> or <a href="#str">str</a>.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <a href="../Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> contains the result of the operating system's GetLastError() function.</p>

<h2 id="load">Performance</h2>
<p>When making repeated calls to a DLL, performance can be dramatically improved by loading it explicitly (<em>this is not necessary for a <a href="#std">standard DLL</a> such as User32 because it is always resident</em>). This practice avoids the need for DllCall to internally call LoadLibrary and FreeLibrary each time. For example:</p>
<pre>hModule := DllCall("<strong>LoadLibrary</strong>", "Str", "MyFunctions.dll", "Ptr")  <em>; Avoids the need for DllCall in the loop to load the library.</em>
Loop Files, "C:\My Documents\*.*", "R"
    result := DllCall("MyFunctions\BackupFile", "Str", A_LoopFilePath)
DllCall("<strong>FreeLibrary</strong>", "Ptr", hModule)  <em>; To conserve memory, the DLL may be unloaded after using it.</em></pre>
<p>Even faster performance can be achieved by looking up the function's address beforehand. For example:</p>
<pre><em>; In the following example, if the DLL isn't yet loaded, use LoadLibrary in place of GetModuleHandle.</em>
<strong>MulDivProc</strong> := DllCall("GetProcAddress", "Ptr", DllCall("GetModuleHandle", "Str", "<strong>kernel32</strong>", "Ptr"), "AStr", "<strong>MulDiv</strong>", "Ptr")
Loop 500
    DllCall(<strong>MulDivProc</strong>, "Int", 3, "Int", 4, "Int", 3)</pre>
<p>If DllCall's first parameter is a literal string such as <code>"MulDiv"</code> and the DLL containing the function is ordinarily loaded before the script starts, or has been successfully loaded with <a href="_DllLoad.htm">#DllLoad</a>, the string is automatically resolved to a function address. This built-in optimization is more effective than the example shown above.</p>
<p>Finally, when passing a string-variable to a function that will not change the length of the string, performance is improved by passing the variable <a href="StrPtr.htm">by address</a> (e.g. <code>StrPtr(MyVar)</code>) rather than as a "<a href="#str">str</a>" (especially when the string is very long). The following example converts a string to uppercase: <code>DllCall("CharUpper", "<strong>Ptr</strong>", StrPtr(MyVar), "Ptr")</code>.</p>

<h2 id="struct">Structures and Arrays</h2>
<p>A structure is a collection of <em>members</em> (fields) stored adjacently in memory. Most members tend to be integers.</p>
<p>Functions that accept the address of a structure (or a memory-block array) can be called by allocating memory by some means and passing the memory address to the function. The <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a> object is recommended for this purpose. The following steps are generally used:</p>
<p>1) Call <code>MyStruct := Buffer(123, 0)</code> to allocate a buffer to hold the structure's data. Replace <code>123</code> with a number that is at least as large as the size of the structure, in bytes. Specifying zero as the last parameter is optional; it initializes all members to be binary zero, which is typically used to avoid calling NumPut as often in the next step.</p>
<p>2) If the target function uses the values initially in the structure, call <code><a href="NumPut.htm">NumPut</a>("UInt", 123, MyStruct, 4)</code> to initialize any members that should be non-zero. Replace <code>123</code> with the integer to be put into the target member (or specify <code>StrPtr(Var)</code> to store the address of a string). Replace <code>4</code> with the offset of the target member (see step #4 for description of "offset"). Replace <code>"UInt"</code> with the appropriate type, such as <code>"Ptr"</code> if the member is a pointer or handle.</p>
<p>3) Call the target function, passing <em>MyStruct</em> as a Ptr argument. For example, <code>DllCall("MyDll\MyFunc", "Ptr", MyStruct)</code>. The function will examine and/or change some of the members. DllCall automatically uses the address of the buffer, which is normally retrieved by using <code>MyStruct.Ptr</code>.</p>
<p>4) Use <code>MyInteger := <a href="NumGet.htm">NumGet</a>(MyStruct, 4, "UInt")</code> to retrieve any desired integers from the structure. Replace <code>4</code> with the offset of the target member in the structure. The first member is always at offset 0. The second member is at offset 0 plus the size of the first member (typically 4). Members beyond the second are at the offset of the previous member plus the size of the previous member. Most members -- such as DWORD, Int, and <a href="#Int">other types of 32-bit integers</a> -- are 4 bytes in size. Replace <code>"UInt"</code> with the appropriate type or omit it if the member is a pointer or handle.</p>
<p>See <a href="#ExStruct">Structure Examples</a> for actual usages.</p>

<h2 id="limits">Known Limitations</h2>
<p>When a variable's string address (e.g. <code>StrPtr(MyVar)</code>) is passed to a function and that function alters the length of the variable's contents, subsequent uses of the variable may behave incorrectly. To fix this, do one of the following: 1) Pass <em>MyVar</em> as a <a href="#str">"Str"</a> argument rather than as a Ptr/address; 2) Call <code><a href="VarSetStrCapacity.htm#neg1">VarSetStrCapacity</a>(MyVar, -1)</code> to update the variable's internally-stored length after calling DllCall.</p>
<p>Any binary zero stored in a variable by a function may act as a terminator, preventing all data to the right of the zero from being accessed or changed by most built-in functions. However, such data can be manipulated by retrieving the string's address with <a href="StrPtr.htm">StrPtr</a> and passing it to other functions, such as <a href="NumPut.htm">NumPut</a>, <a href="NumGet.htm">NumGet</a>, <a href="StrGet.htm">StrGet</a>, <a href="StrPut.htm">StrPut</a>, and DllCall itself.</p>
<p>A function that returns the address of one of the strings that was passed into it might return an identical string in a different memory address than expected. For example calling <code>CharLower(CharUpper(MyVar))</code> in a programming language would convert <em>MyVar</em>'s contents to lowercase. But when the same is done with DllCall, <em>MyVar</em> would be uppercase after the following call because CharLower would have operated on a different/temporary string whose contents were identical to <em>MyVar</em>:</p>
<pre>MyVar := "ABC"
result := DllCall("CharLower", "<strong><u>Str</u></strong>", DllCall("CharUpper", "Str", MyVar, "<strong><u>Str</u></strong>"), "Str")</pre>
<p>To work around this, change the two underlined "Str" values above to Ptr. This interprets CharUpper's return value as a pure address that will get passed as an integer to CharLower.</p>
<p>Certain limitations may be encountered when dealing with strings. For details, see <a href="../Compat.htm#DllCall">Binary Compatibility</a>.</p>

<h2 id="COM">Component Object Model (COM)</h2>
<p>COM objects which are accessible to VBScript and similar languages are typically also accessible to AutoHotkey via <a href="ComObject.htm">ComObject</a>, <a href="ComObjGet.htm">ComObjGet</a> or <a href="ComObjActive.htm">ComObjActive</a> and the built-in <a href="../Objects.htm#Usage_Objects">object syntax</a>.</p>
<p>COM objects which don't support <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-idispatch">IDispatch</a> can be used with DllCall by retrieving the address of a function from the virtual function table of the object's interface. For more details, see <a href="#ExTaskbar">the example</a> further below. However, it is usually better to use <a href="ComCall.htm">ComCall</a>, which streamlines this process.</p>

<h2 id="dotnet">.NET Framework</h2>
<p>.NET Framework libraries are executed by a "virtual machine" known as the Common Language Runtime, or CLR. That being the case, .NET DLL files are formatted differently to normal DLL files, and generally do not contain any functions which DllCall is capable of calling.</p>
<p>However, AutoHotkey can utilize the CLR through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/native-interop/com-callable-wrapper">COM callable wrappers</a>. Unless the library is also registered as a general COM component, the CLR itself must first be manually initialized via DllCall. For details, see <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic26191.html">.NET Framework Interop</a> (which currently utilizes DllCall and is not compatible with AutoHotkey v2).</p>

<p>This function downloads to a file. To download to a variable instead, see the example below. For alternative methods, see the following forum topic: <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic10466.html">www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic10466.html</a></p>
<p>The download might appear to succeed even when the remote file doesn't exist. This is because many web servers send an error page instead of the missing file. This error page is what will be saved in place of <em>Filename</em>.</p>
<p>Firewalls or the presence of multiple network adapters may cause this function to fail. Also, some websites may block such downloads.</p>
<p><strong>Caching</strong>: By default, the URL is retrieved directly from the remote server (that is, never from Internet Explorer's cache). To permit caching, precede the URL with *0 followed by a space; for example: <em>*0 http://someorg.org</em>. The zero following the asterisk may be replaced by any valid dwFlags number; for details, search <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a> for  InternetOpenUrl.</p>
<p><strong>Proxies</strong>: If a proxy server has been configured in Microsoft Internet Explorer's settings, it will be used.</p>
<p><strong>FTP and Gopher</strong> URLS are also supported. For example:</p>
<pre>Download "ftp://example.com/home/My File.zip", "C:\My Folder\My File.zip"  <em>; Log in anonymously.</em>
Download "ftp://user:pass@example.com:21/home/My File.zip", "C:\My Folder\My File.zip"  <em>; Log in as a specific user.</em>

<h1>DriveEject / DriveRetract</h1>

<p>Ejects or retracts the tray of the specified CD/DVD drive, or ejects a removable drive.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">DriveEject</span> <span class="optional">Drive</span>
<span class="func">DriveRetract</span> <span class="optional">Drive</span></pre>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Drive</dt>
  
    <dd>
        <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
        <p>The drive letter optionally followed by a colon or a colon and backslash. For example, <code>D</code>, <code class="no-highlight">D:</code> or <code>D:\</code>.</p>
        <p>This can also be a device path in the form <code>\\?\Volume{...}</code>, which can be discovered by running <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mountvol">mountvol</a> at the command line. In this case the drive is not required to be assigned a drive letter.</p>
        <p>If omitted, it defaults to the first CD/DVD drive found by iterating from A to Z. An exception is thrown if no drive is found.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>An exception is thrown on failure, if detected.</p>
<p>These functions will probably not work on a network drive or any drive lacking the "Eject" option in Explorer. The underlying system functions do not always report failure, so an exception may or may not be thrown.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This function waits for the ejection or retraction to complete before allowing the script to continue.</p>
<p>It may be possible to detect the previous tray state by measuring the time the function takes to complete, as in <a href="#ExToggle">the example below</a>.</p>
<p>Ejecting a removable drive is generally equivalent to using the "Eject" context menu option in Explorer, except that no warning is shown if files are in use. Unlike the Safely Remove Hardware option, this only dismounts the volume identified by the <em>Drive</em> parameter, not the overall device.</p>
<p>DriveEject and DriveRetract correspond to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_eject_media">IOCTL_STORAGE_EJECT_MEDIA</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_load_media">IOCTL_STORAGE_LOAD_MEDIA</a> control codes, which may also have an effect on drive types other than CD/DVD, such as tape drives.</p>

<p>This function needs to be called multiple times if the drive was locked multiple times (at least for some drives). For example, if <code>DriveLock("D:")</code> was called three times, <code>DriveUnlock("D:")</code> might need to be called three times to unlock it. Because of this and the fact that there is no way to determine whether a drive is currently locked, it is often useful to keep track of its lock-state in a <a href="../Variables.htm">variable</a>.</p>

<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>Opens the current script for editing in the associated editor.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Edit</span></pre>
<p>The Edit function opens the current script for editing using the associated "edit" verb in the registry (or Notepad if no verb). However, if an editor window appears to have the script already open (based on its window title), that window is activated instead of opening a new instance of the editor.</p>
<p>The default program, script or command line executed by the "edit" verb can be changed via <em>Editor settings</em> in the <a href="../Program.htm#dash">Dash</a>.</p>
<p>This function  has no effect when operating from within a compiled script.</p>
<p>On a related note, AutoHotkey syntax highlighting can be enabled for <a href="../misc/Editors.htm">various editors</a>. In addition, context sensitive help for AutoHotkey functions can be enabled in any editor via <a href="../scripts/index.htm#ContextSensitiveHelp">this example</a>. Finally, your productivity may be improved by using an auto-completion utility like <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=31484">the script by boiler</a> or <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=27882">the script by Helgef</a>, which works in almost any editor. It watches what you type and displays menus and parameter lists, which does some of the typing for you and reminds you of the order of parameters.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Else</span>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Every use of an <em>Else</em> must belong to (be associated with) an <a href="If.htm">If statement</a>, <a href="Catch.htm">Catch</a>, <a href="For.htm">For</a>, <a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a> or <a href="While.htm">While</a> statement above it. An <em>Else</em> always belongs to the nearest applicable unclaimed statement above it unless a <a href="Block.htm">block</a> is used to change that behavior. The condition for an <em>Else</em> statement executing depends on the associated statement:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="If.htm">If expression</a>: The expression evaluated to false.</li>
  <li><a href="For.htm">For</a>, <a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a> (any kind), <a href="While.htm">While</a>: The loop had zero iterations.</li>
  <li><a href="LoopRead.htm">Loop Read</a>: As above, but the presence of <em>Else</em> also prevents an error from being thrown if the file or path is not found. Therefore, <em>Else</em> executes if the file is empty or does not exist.</li>
  <li><a href="Try.htm">Try</a>...<a href="Catch.htm">Catch</a>: No exception was thrown within the try block.</li>
</ul>
<p>An <em>Else</em> can be followed immediately by any other single <a href="../Concepts.htm#statement">statement</a> on the same line. This is most often used for "else if" ladders (see examples at the bottom).</p>
<p>If an <em>Else</em> owns more than one line, those lines must be enclosed in braces (to create a <a href="Block.htm">block</a>). However, if only one line belongs to an <em>Else</em>, the braces are optional. For example:</p>
<pre>if (count &gt; 0)  <em>; No braces are required around the next line because it's only a single line.</em>
    MsgBox "Press OK to begin the process."
else  <em>; Braces must be used around the section below because it consists of more than one line.</em>
{
    WinClose "Untitled - Notepad"
    MsgBox "There are no items present."
}</pre>
<p>The <a href="Block.htm#otb">One True Brace (OTB) style</a> may optionally be used around an <em>Else</em>. For example:</p>

<h1>Enumerator Object</h1>

<p>An enumerator is a type of <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">function object</a> which is called repeatedly to enumerate a sequence of values.</p>
<p>Enumerators exist primarily to support <a href="For.htm">For-loops</a>, and are not usually called directly. The for-loop documentation details the process by which an enumerator is called. The script may implement an enumerator to control which values are assigned to the for-loop's variables on each iteration of the loop.</p>
<p>Built-in enumerators are instances of the <code>Enumerator</code> class (which is derived from <a href="Func.htm">Func</a>), but any function object can potentially be used with a for-loop.</p>

    <p>One or more references to output variables for the enumerator to assign values.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>Returns a non-zero integer if successful or zero if there were no items remaining.</p>
<p>A simple function definition can be used to create an enumerator; in that case, the Call method is implied.</p>
<p>When defining your own enumerator, the number of parameters should match the number of variables expected to be passed to the for-loop (before the "in" keyword). This is usually either 1 or 2, but a for-loop can accept up to 19 variables. To allow the method to accept a varying number of variables, declare <a href="../Functions.htm#optional">optional parameters</a>.</p>
<p>An exception is thrown when the for-loop attempts to call the method if there are more variables than parameters (too many parameters passed, too few defined) or fewer variables than mandatory parameters.</p>

<h1>Error Object</h1>
<pre class="NoIndent">class Error extends Object</pre>

<p>Error objects are <a href="Throw.htm">thrown</a> by built-in code when a runtime error occurs, and may also be thrown explicitly by the script.</p>

  <li><a href="#error-types">Error Types</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Related">Related</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Standard_Properties">Standard Properties</h2>
<p id="Message"><strong>Message:</strong> An error message.</p>
<p id="What"><strong>What:</strong> What threw the exception. This is usually the name of a function, but is blank for exceptions thrown due to an error in an expression (such as using a math operator on a non-numeric value).</p>
<p id="Extra"><strong>Extra:</strong> A string value relating to the error, if available. If this value can be converted to a non-empty string, the standard error dialog displays a line with "Specifically:" followed by this string.</p>
<p id="File"><strong>File:</strong> The full path of the script file which contains the line at which the error occurred, or at which the Error object was constructed.</p>
<p id="Line"><strong>Line:</strong> The line number at which the error occurred, or at which the Error object was constructed.</p>
<p id="Stack"><strong>Stack:</strong> A string representing the call stack at the time the Error object was constructed. Each line may be formatted as follows:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code><i>File</i> (<i>Line</i>) : [<i>What</i>] <i>SourceCode</i>`r`n</code></dt>
  <dd>Represents a call to the function <em>What</em>. <em>File</em> and <em>Line</em> indicate the current script line at this stack depth. <em>SourceCode</em> is an approximation of the source code at that line, as it would be shown in <a href="ListLines.htm">ListLines</a>.</dd>
  <dt><code>&gt; <i>What</i>`r`n</code></dt>
  <dd>Represents the launching of a thread, typically the direct cause of the function call above it.</dd>
  <dt><code>... <i>N</i> more</code></dt>
  <dd>Indicates that the stack trace was truncated, and there are <em>N</em> more stack entries not shown. Currently the <code>Stack</code> property cannot exceed 2047 characters.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> The standard error dialog requires <em>Message</em>, <em>Extra</em>, <em>File</em> and <em>Line</em> to be <a href="Object.htm">own value properties</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new">Error()</h2>
<p>Creates an Error object.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">NewError := <span class="func"><i>Error</i></span>(Message <span class="optional">, What, Extra</span>)</pre>
<p><em><strong>Error</strong></em> may be replaced with one of the subclasses listed under <a href="#error-types">Error Types</a>, although some subclasses may take different parameters.</p>
<p>The parameters directly correspond to properties described above, but may differ for Error subclasses which override the __New method.</p>
<p><em>Message</em> and <em>Extra</em> are converted to strings. These are displayed by an error dialog if the exception is thrown and not caught.</p>
<p><em>What</em> indicates the source of the error. It can be an arbitrary string, but should be a negative integer or the name of a running function. Specifying -1 indicates the current function, -2 indicates the function which called it, and so on. If the script is <a href="../Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">compiled</a> or the value does not identify a valid stack frame, the value is merely converted to a string and assigned to <code>NewError.What</code>. Otherwise, the identified stack frame is used as follows to determine the other properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>NewError.What</code> contains the name of the function.</li>
  <li><code>NewError.Line</code> and <code>NewError.File</code> indicate the line which <em>called</em> the function.</li>
  <li><code>NewError.Stack</code> contains a partial stack trace, with the indicated stack frame at the top.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of the <em>What</em> parameter can allow a complex function to use helper functions to perform its work or parameter validation, while omitting those internal details from any reported error information. For example:</p>
<pre>MyFunction(a, b) {
    CheckArg "a", a
    CheckArg "b", b
    <em>;...</em>
    CheckArg(name, value) {
        if value &lt; 0
            throw ValueError(name " is negative", "myfunction", value)
    }
}

try
    MyFunction(1, -1)  <em>; err.Line indicates this line.</em>
catch ValueError as err
    MsgBox Format("{1}: {2}.`n`nFile:`t{3}`nLine:`t{4}`nWhat:`t{5}`nStack:`n{6}"
        , type(err), err.Message, err.File, err.Line, err.What, err.Stack)</pre>
<pre>try
    SomeFunction()
catch as e
    MsgBox(type(e) " in " e.What ", which was called at line " e.Line)

SomeFunction() {
    throw Error("Fail", -1)
}</pre>

<h2 id="error-types">Error Types</h2>

<p>The following subclasses of <strong>Error</strong> are predefined:</p>
<ul>
  <li id="MemoryError"><strong>MemoryError</strong>: A memory allocation failed.</li>
  <li id="OSError"><strong>OSError</strong>: An internal function call to a Win32 function failed. <strong>Message</strong> includes an error code and description generated by the operating system. OSErrors have an additional <strong>Number</strong> property which contains the error code. Calling <code>OSError(code)</code> with a numeric <em>code</em> sets <em>Number</em> and <em>Message</em> based on the given OS-defined error code. If <em>code</em> is omitted it defaults to <code>A_LastError</code>.</li>
  <li id="TargetError"><strong>TargetError</strong>: A function failed because its target could not be found. <strong>Message</strong> indicates what kind of target, such as a window, control, menu or status bar.</li>
  <li id="TimeoutError"><strong>TimeoutError</strong>: <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> timed out.</li>
  <li id="TypeError"><strong>TypeError</strong>: An unexpected type of value was used as input for a function, property assignment, or some other operation. Usually <strong>Message</strong> indicates the expected and actual type, and <strong>Extra</strong> contains a string representing the errant value.</li>
  <li id="UnsetError"><strong>UnsetError</strong>: An attempt was made to read the value of a variable, property or item, but there was no value.<ul>
    <li id="MemberError"><strong>MemberError</strong><ul>
      <li id="PropertyError"><strong>PropertyError</strong></li>
      <li id="MethodError"><strong>MethodError</strong></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li id="UnsetItemError"><strong>UnsetItemError</strong></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li id="ValueError"><strong>ValueError</strong>: An unexpected value was used as input for a function, property assignment, or some other operation. Usually <strong>Message</strong> indicates which expectation was broken, and <strong>Extra</strong> contains a string representing the errant value.<ul>
    <li id="IndexError"><strong>IndexError</strong>: The index parameter of an object's <a href="../Objects.htm#__Item">__Item property</a> was invalid or out of range.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li id="ZeroDivisionError"><strong>ZeroDivisionError</strong>: Division by zero was attempted in an expression or with the Mod function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Errors are also thrown using the base Error class.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The Exit function terminates only the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a>. In other words, the stack of functions called directly or indirectly by a <a href="Menu.htm">menu</a>, <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a>, or <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> function will all be returned from as though a <a href="Return.htm">Return</a> were immediately encountered in each. If used directly inside such a function -- or in <a href="../Language.htm#global-code">global code</a> -- Exit is equivalent to <a href="Return.htm">Return</a>.</p>
<p>If the script is not <a href="../Scripts.htm#persistent">persistent</a> and this is the last thread, the script will terminate after the thread exits.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This is equivalent to choosing "Exit" from the script's tray menu or main menu.</p>
<p>Any <a href="OnExit.htm">OnExit</a> functions registered by the script are called before the script terminates. If an OnExit function returns a non-zero integer, the script does not terminate; instead, the current <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> exits as if <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> was called.</p>
<p>Terminating the script is not the same as exiting each thread. For instance, <a href="Finally.htm">Finally</a> blocks are not executed and <a href="../Objects.htm#Custom_NewDelete">__Delete</a> is not called for objects contained by local variables.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">Pos := FileObj.Pos</pre>
<pre class="Syntax">FileObj.Pos := NewPos</pre>
<p>Equivalent to <code>FileObj.Seek(NewPos)</code>.</p>
<p>The position is a byte offset from the beginning of the file, where 0 is the first byte. When data is written to or read from the file, the file pointer automatically moves to the next byte after that data.</p>
</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="Length"><h3>Length</h3>
<p>Retrieves or sets the size of the file.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">FileSize := FileObj.Length</pre>
<pre class="Syntax">FileObj.Length := NewSize</pre>
<p><em>FileSize</em> and <em>NewSize</em> is the size of the file, in bytes.</p>
<p>This property should be used only with an actual file. If the File object was created from a handle to a pipe, it may return the amount of data currently available in the pipe's internal buffer, but this behaviour is not guaranteed.</p></div>

<div class="methodShort" id="AtEOF"><h3>AtEOF</h3>
  <p>Retrieves a non-zero value if the file pointer has reached the end of the file, otherwise zero.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">IsAtEOF := FileObj.AtEOF</pre>
  <p>This property should be used only with an actual file. If the File object was created from a handle to a non-seeking device such as a console buffer or pipe, the returned value may not be meaningful, as such devices do not logically have an "end of file".</p></div>

<div class="methodShort" id="Encoding"><h3>Encoding</h3>
<p>Retrieves or sets the text encoding used by this file object.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">RetrievedEncoding := FileObj.Encoding</pre>
<pre class="Syntax">FileObj.Encoding := NewEncoding</pre>
  <p><em>NewEncoding</em> may be a numeric code page identifier (see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/intl/code-page-identifiers">Microsoft Docs</a>) or one of the following strings.</p>
  <p><em>RetrievedEncoding</em> is one of the following strings:</p>
  <ul>
	<li><code>UTF-8</code>: Unicode UTF-8, equivalent to CP65001.</li>
	<li><code>UTF-16</code>: Unicode UTF-16 with little endian byte order, equivalent to CP1200.</li>
	<li><code>CP<i>nnn</i></code>: a code page with numeric identifier <i>nnn</i>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>RetrievedEncoding</em> is never a value with the <code>-RAW</code> suffix, regardless of how the file was opened or whether it contains a byte order mark (BOM). Setting <em>NewEncoding</em> never causes a BOM to be added or removed, as the BOM is normally written to the file when it is first created.</p>
  <p>Setting <em>NewEncoding</em> to <code>UTF-8-RAW</code> or <code>UTF-16-RAW</code> is valid, but the <code>-RAW</code> suffix is ignored. This only applies to <code>FileObj.Encoding</code>, not <a href="FileOpen.htm">FileOpen</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="Handle"><h3>Handle</h3>
  <p>Returns a system file handle, intended for use with DllCall. See <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea">CreateFile</a>.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">FileObj.Handle</pre>
<p>File objects internally buffer reads or writes. If data has been written into the object's internal buffer, it is committed to disk before the handle is returned. If the buffer contains data read from file, it is discarded and the actual file pointer is reset to the logical position indicated by <code>FileObj.Pos</code>.</p></div>

<dl>

  <dt>Text</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#objects">Object</a></p>
    <p>The text or raw binary data to append to the file. Text may include linefeed characters (`n) to start new lines. In addition, a single long line can be broken up into several shorter ones by means of a <a href="../Scripts.htm#continuation">continuation section</a>.</p>
    <p>A <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a>-like object may be passed to append raw binary data. If a file is created, a byte order mark (BOM) is written only if "UTF-8" or "UTF-16" has been specified within <em>Options</em>. The <a href="../Variables.htm#FileEncoding">default encoding</a> is ignored and the data contained by the object is written as-is, regardless of <em>Options</em>. Any object which implements <a href="Buffer.htm#Ptr">Ptr</a> and <a href="Buffer.htm#Size">Size</a> properties may be used.</p>
    <p>If <em>Text</em> is blank, <em>Filename</em> will be created as an empty file (but if the file already exists, its modification time will be updated).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Filename</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The name of the file to be appended, which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified. The destination directory must already exist.</p>
    <p id="stdout"><strong>Standard Output (stdout)</strong>: Specifying an asterisk (*) for <em>Filename</em> causes <em>Text</em> to be sent to standard output (stdout). Such text can be redirected to a file, piped to another EXE, or captured by <a href="_ErrorStdOut.htm">fancy text editors</a>. For example, the following would be valid if typed at a command prompt:</p>
      <pre class="no-highlight">"%ProgramFiles%\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" "My Script.ahk" &gt;"Error Log.txt"</pre>
    <p>However, text sent to stdout will not appear at the command prompt it was launched from. This can be worked around by 1) compiling the script with the <a href="../misc/Ahk2ExeDirectives.htm#ConsoleApp">Ahk2Exe ConsoleApp directive</a>, or 2) piping a script's output to another command or program. For example:</p>
      <pre class="no-highlight">"%ProgramFiles%\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" "My Script.ahk" |more</pre>
      <pre class="no-highlight">For /F "tokens=*" %L in ('""%ProgramFiles%\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" "My Script .ahk""') do @Echo %L</pre>
    <p>Specifying two asterisks (**) for <em>Filename</em> causes <em>Text</em> to be sent to the standard error stream (stderr).</p>
    </dd>

  <dt>Options</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>Zero or more of the following strings. Separate each option from the next with a single space or tab. For example: <code>"`n UTF-8"</code></p>
    <p><strong>Encoding</strong>: Specify any of the encoding names accepted by <a href="FileEncoding.htm">FileEncoding</a> (excluding the empty string) to use that encoding if the file lacks a UTF-8 or UTF-16 byte order mark. If omitted, it defaults to <a href="../Variables.htm#FileEncoding">A_FileEncoding</a> (unless <em>Text</em> is an object, in which case no byte order mark is written).</p>
    <p><strong>RAW</strong>: Specify the word RAW (case-insensitive) to write the exact bytes contained by <em>Text</em> to the file as-is, without any conversion. This option overrides any previously specified encoding and vice versa. If <em>Text</em> is not an object, the data size is always a multiple of 2 bytes due to the use of UTF-16 strings.</p>
    <p><strong>`n</strong> (a linefeed character): Inserts a carriage return (`r) before each linefeed (`n) if one is not already present. In other words, it translates from `n to `r`n. This translation typically does not affect performance. If this option is not used, line endings within <em>Text</em> are not changed.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>SourcePattern</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The name of a single file or folder, or a wildcard pattern such as C:\Temp\*.tmp. <em>SourcePattern</em> is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>DestPattern</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The name or pattern of the destination, which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
    <p>If present, the first asterisk (<code>*</code>) in the filename is replaced with the source filename excluding its extension, while the first asterisk after the last full stop (<code>.</code>) is replaced with the source file's extension. If an asterisk is present but the extension is omitted, the source file's extension is used.</p>
    <p>To perform a simple copy -- retaining the existing file name(s) -- specify only the folder name as shown in these mostly equivalent examples:</p>
    <pre>FileCopy "C:\*.txt", "C:\My Folder"</pre>
    <pre>FileCopy "C:\*.txt", "C:\My Folder\*.*"</pre>
    <p>The destination directory must already exist. If <em>My Folder</em> does not exist, the first example above will use "My Folder" as the target filename, while the second example will copy no files.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Overwrite</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>This parameter determines whether to overwrite files if they already exist. If this parameter is 1 (true), the function overwrites existing files. If omitted or 0 (false), the function does not overwrite existing files.</p>
    <p>Other values are reserved for future use.</p>
  </dd>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>An <a href="Error.htm">Error</a> is thrown if any files failed to be copied, with its <a href="Error.htm#Extra">Extra</a> property set to the number of failures. If no files were found, an error is thrown only if <em>SourcePattern</em> lacks the wildcards <code>*</code> and <code>?</code>. In other words, copying a wildcard pattern such as <code>"*.txt"</code> is considered a success when it does not match any files.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="FileMove.htm">FileMove</a>, copying a file onto itself is always counted as an error, even if the overwrite mode is in effect.</p>
<p>If files were found, <a href="../Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> is set to 0 (zero) or the result of the operating system's GetLastError() function immediately after the last failure. Otherwise A_LastError contains an error code that might indicate why no files were found.</p>

<p>An alternative way to create a shortcut to a URL is the following example, which creates a special URL shortcut. Change the first two parameters to suit your preferences:</p>
<pre><a href="IniWrite.htm">IniWrite</a> "https://www.google.com", "C:\My Shortcut.url", "InternetShortcut", "URL"</pre>
<p>The following may be optionally added to assign an icon to the above:</p>

<a href="IniWrite.htm">IniWrite</a> 0, "C:\My Shortcut.url", "InternetShortcut", "IconIndex"</pre>
<p>In the above, replace <code>0</code> with the index of the icon (0 is used for the first icon) and replace <code>&lt;IconFile&gt;</code> with a URL, EXE, DLL, or ICO file. Examples: <code>"C:\Icons.dll"</code>, <code>"C:\App.exe"</code>, <code>"https://www.somedomain.com/ShortcutIcon.ico"</code></p>
<p>The operating system will treat a .URL file created by the above as a real shortcut even though it is a plain text file rather than a .LNK file.</p>

<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_FileEncoding</strong> contains the current setting.</p>
<p>If not otherwise set by the script, the default is CP0.</p>
<p>CP0 does not universally identify a single code page; rather, it corresponds to the system default ANSI code page, which depends on the system locale or "language for non-Unicode programs" system setting. If CP0 is the current setting, <a href="../Variables.htm#FileEncoding">A_FileEncoding</a> returns CP0 (never a blank value). To get the actual code page number, call <code>DllCall("GetACP")</code>.</p>

That default may be changed by using this function during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>.</p>
<p>The default encoding is not used if a UTF-8 or UTF-16 byte order mark is present in the file, unless the file is being opened with write-only access (i.e. the previous contents of the file are being discarded).</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>FilePattern</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The path, filename, or file pattern to check. <em>FilePattern</em> is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>This function returns the attributes of the first matching file or folder. This string is a subset of <code>RASHNDOCT</code>, where each letter means the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>R = READONLY</li>
    <li>A = ARCHIVE</li>
    <li>S = SYSTEM</li>
    <li>H = HIDDEN</li>
    <li>N = NORMAL</li>
    <li>D = DIRECTORY</li>
    <li>O = OFFLINE</li>
    <li>C = COMPRESSED</li>
    <li>T = TEMPORARY</li>
    <li>L = REPARSE_POINT (typically a symbolic link)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the file has no attributes (rare), "X" is returned. If no file or folder is found, an empty string is returned.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Note that a wildcard check like <code>InStr(FileExist("FolderWithFilesAndSubfolders\*"), "D")</code> only tells you whether the <em>first</em> matching file is a folder, not whether a folder exists. To check for the latter, use <a href="DirExist.htm">DirExist</a>. For example: <code>DirExist("FolderWithFilesAndSubfolders\*")</code></p>
<p>Unlike <a href="FileGetAttrib.htm">FileGetAttrib</a>, FileExist supports wildcard patterns and always returns a non-empty value if a matching file exists.</p>
<p>Since an empty string is seen as "false", the function's return value can always be used as a quasi-boolean value. For example, the statement <code>if FileExist("C:\My File.txt")</code> would be true if the file exists and false otherwise.</p>
<p>Since <em>FilePattern</em> may contain wildcards, FileExist may be unsuitable for validating a file path which is to be used with another function or program. For example, <code>FileExist("*.txt")</code> may return attributes even though "*.txt" is not a valid filename. In such cases, <a href="FileGetAttrib.htm">FileGetAttrib</a> is preferred.</p>

<h1>FileInstall</h1>

<p>Includes the specified file inside the <a href="../Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">compiled version</a> of the script.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">FileInstall</span> Source, Dest <span class="optional">, Overwrite</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Source</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The name of a single file to be added to the compiled EXE. The file is assumed to be in (or relative to) the script's own directory if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
    <p>This parameter must be a <a href="../Language.htm#strings">quoted literal string</a> (not a variable or any other expression), and must be listed to the right of the function name <em>FileInstall</em> (that is, not on a <a href="../Scripts.htm#continuation">continuation line</a> beneath it).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Dest</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>When <em>Source</em> is extracted from the EXE, this is the name of the file to be created. It is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn&#39;t specified. The destination directory must already exist.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Overwrite</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>This parameter determines whether to overwrite files if they already exist. If this parameter is 1 (true), the function overwrites existing files. If omitted or 0 (false), the function does not overwrite existing files.</p>
    <p>Other values are reserved for future use.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>An exception is thrown on failure.</p>

<p>Any case where the file cannot be written to the destination is considered failure. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The destination file already exists and the <em>Overwrite</em> parameter was 0 (false) or omitted.</li>
  <li>The destination file could not be opened due to a permission error, or because the file is in use.</li>
  <li>The destination path was invalid or specifies a folder which does not exist.</li>
  <li>The source file does not exist (only for uncompiled scripts).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>When a call to this function is read by <a href="../Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">Ahk2Exe</a> during compilation of the script, the file specified by <em>Source</em> is added to the resulting compiled script. Later, when the compiled script EXE runs and the call to FileInstall is executed, the file is extracted from the EXE and written to the location specified by <em>Dest</em>.</p>
<p>Files added to a script are neither compressed nor encrypted during compilation, but the compiled script EXE can be compressed by using the appropriate option in Ahk2Exe.</p>
<p>If this function is used in a normal (uncompiled) script, a simple file copy will be performed instead -- this helps the testing of scripts that will eventually be compiled. No action is taken if the full source and destination paths are equal, as attempting to copy the file to its current location would result in an error. The paths are compared with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-lstrcmpiw">lstrcmpi</a> after expansion with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfullpathnamew">GetFullPathName</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>SourcePattern</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The name of a single file or a wildcard pattern such as C:\Temp\*.tmp. <em>SourcePattern</em> is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>DestPattern</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The name or pattern of the  destination, which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
    <p>If present, the first asterisk (<code>*</code>) in the filename is replaced with the source filename excluding its extension, while the first asterisk after the last full stop (<code>.</code>) is replaced with the source file's extension. If an asterisk is present but the extension is omitted, the source file's extension is used.</p>
    <p>To perform a simple move -- retaining the existing file name(s) -- specify only the folder name as shown in these mostly equivalent examples:</p>
    <pre>FileMove "C:\*.txt", "C:\My Folder"</pre>
    <pre>FileMove "C:\*.txt", "C:\My Folder\*.*"</pre>
    <p>The destination directory must already exist. If <em>My Folder</em> does not exist, the first example above will use "My Folder" as the target filename, while the second example will move no files.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Overwrite</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>This parameter determines whether to overwrite files if they already exist. If this parameter is 1 (true), the function overwrites existing files. If omitted or 0 (false), the function does not overwrite existing files.</p>
    <p>Other values are reserved for future use.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>An <a href="Error.htm">Error</a> is thrown if any files failed to be moved, with its <a href="Error.htm#Extra">Extra</a> property set to the number of failures. If no files were found, an exception is thrown only if <em>SourcePattern</em> lacks the wildcards <code>*</code> and <code>?</code>. In other words, moving a wildcard pattern such as <code>"*.txt"</code> is considered a success when it does not match any files.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="FileCopy.htm">FileCopy</a>, moving a file onto itself is always considered successful, even if the overwrite mode is not in effect.</p>
<p>If files were found, <a href="../Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> is set to 0 (zero) or the result of the operating system's GetLastError() function immediately after the last failure. Otherwise A_LastError contains an error code that might indicate why no files were found.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>FileMove moves files only. To instead move the contents of a folder (all its files and subfolders), see the examples section below. To move or rename a single folder, use <a href="DirMove.htm">DirMove</a>.</p>
<p>The operation will continue even if error(s) are encountered.</p>
<p>Although this function is capable of moving files to a different volume, the operation will take longer than a same-volume move. This is because a same-volume move is similar to a rename, and therefore much faster.</p>

    <p><strong>RAW</strong>: Specify the word RAW (case-insensitive) to read the file's content as <a href="#Binary">raw binary data</a> and return a <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a> object instead of a string. This option overrides any previously specified encoding and vice versa.</p>
    <p><strong>m1024</strong>: If this option is omitted, the entire file is loaded unless there is insufficient memory, in which case an error message is shown and the thread exits (but <a href="Try.htm">Try</a> can be used to avoid this). Otherwise, replace 1024 with a decimal or hexadecimal number of bytes. If the file is larger than this, only its leading part is loaded.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This might result in the last line ending in a naked carriage return (`r) rather than `r`n.</p>
    <p><strong>`n</strong> (a linefeed character): Replaces any/all occurrences of carriage return &amp; linefeed (`r`n) with linefeed (`n). However, this translation reduces performance and is usually not necessary. For example, text containing `r`n is already in the right format to be added to a <a href="StrReplace.htm">Gui Edit control</a>. The following <a href="LoopParse.htm">parsing loop</a> will work correctly regardless of whether each line ends in `r`n or just `n: <code>Loop Parse, MyFileContents, "`n", "`r"</code>.</p>
  </dd>
  
</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a></p>
<p>This function returns the contents of the specified file. The return value is a Buffer object if the RAW option is in effect and the file can be opened; otherwise, it is a string. If the file does not exist or cannot be opened for any other reason, an empty string is returned.</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>An <a href="Error.htm#OSError">OSError</a> is thrown if there was a problem opening or reading the file.</p>
<p>A file greater than 4 GB in size will cause a <a href="Error.htm#MemoryError">MemoryError</a> to be thrown unless the <strong>*m</strong> option is present, in which case the leading part of the file is loaded. A MemoryError will also be thrown if the program is unable to allocate enough memory to contain the requested amount of data.</p>
<p><a href="../Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> is set to the result of the operating system's GetLastError() function.</p>

<h2 id="Binary">Reading Binary Data</h2>
<p>When the <code>RAW</code> option is used, the return value is a <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a> object containing the raw, unmodified contents of the file. The object's <a href="Buffer.htm#Size">Size</a> property returns the number of bytes read. <a href="NumGet.htm">NumGet</a> or <a href="StrGet.htm">StrGet</a> can be used to retrieve data from the buffer. For example:</p>
<pre>buf := FileRead(A_AhkPath, "RAW")
if StrGet(buf, 2, "cp0") == "MZ"  <em>; Looks like an executable file...</em>
{
    <em>; Read machine type from COFF file header.</em>
    machine := NumGet(buf, NumGet(buf, 0x3C, "uint") + 4, "ushort")
    machine := machine=0x8664 ? "x64" : machine=0x014C ? "x86" : "unknown"
    <em>; Display machine type and file size.</em>
    MsgBox "This " machine " executable is " buf.Size " bytes."
}
buf := ""</pre>
<p>This option is generally required for reading binary data because by default, any bytes read from file are interpreted as text and may be converted from the source file's encoding (as specified in the options or by <a href="../Variables.htm#FileEncoding">A_FileEncoding</a>) to the script's <a href="../Compat.htm#Format">native encoding</a>, UTF-16. If the data is not UTF-16 text, this conversion generally changes the data in undesired ways.</p>
<p>For another demonstration of the RAW option, see <a href="ClipboardAll.htm#ExFile">ClipboardAll example #2</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="FileOpen.htm">FileOpen</a> and <a href="File.htm#RawRead">File.RawRead</a> or <a href="File.htm#ReadNum">File.Read<i>Num</i></a> may be used to read binary data without first reading the entire file into memory.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>When the goal is to load all or a large part of a file into memory, FileRead performs much better than using a <a href="LoopRead.htm">file-reading loop</a>.</p>
<p>If there is concern about using too much memory, check the file size beforehand with <a href="FileGetSize.htm">FileGetSize</a>.</p>
<p><a href="FileOpen.htm">FileOpen</a> provides more advanced functionality than FileRead, such as reading or writing data at a specific location in the file without reading the entire file into memory. See <a href="File.htm">File Object</a> for a list of functions.</p>

<h1>FileSelect</h1>

<p>Displays a standard dialog  that allows the user to open or save file(s).</p>

<pre class="Syntax">SelectedFile := <span class="func">FileSelect</span>(<span class="optional">Options, RootDir\Filename, Title, Filter</span>)</pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Options</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
      <p>If omitted, it will default to zero, which is the same as having none of the options below.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, it can be a number or one of the letters listed below, optionally followed by a number. For example, <code>"M"</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>"M1"</code> are all valid (but not equivalent).</p>
      <p id="D"><strong>D</strong>: Select Folder (Directory). Specify the letter D to allow the user to select a folder rather than a file. The dialog has most of the same features as when selecting a file, but does not support filters (<em>Filter</em> must be omitted or blank).</p>
      <p id="M"><strong>M</strong>: Multi-select. Specify the letter M to allow the user to select more than one file via shift-click, control-click, or other means. In this case, the return value is an <a href="Array.htm">Array</a> instead of a string. To extract the individual files, see the example at the bottom of this page.</p>
      <p id="S"><strong>S</strong>: Save dialog. Specify the letter S to cause the dialog to always contain a Save button instead of an Open button.</p>
      <p>The following numbers can be used. To put more than one of them into effect, add them up. For example, to use 1 and 2, specify the number 3.</p>
      <p><strong>1</strong>: File Must Exist<br>
        <strong>2</strong>: Path Must Exist<br>
        <strong>8</strong>: Prompt to Create New File<br>
        <strong>16</strong>: Prompt to Overwrite File<br>
        <strong>32</strong>: Shortcuts (.lnk files) are selected as-is rather than being resolved to their targets. This option also prevents navigation into a folder via a folder shortcut.</p>
      <p>As the "Prompt to Overwrite" option is supported only by the Save dialog, specifying that option without the "Prompt to Create" option also puts the "S" option into effect. Similarly, the "Prompt to Create" option has no effect when the "S" option is present. Specifying the number 24 enables whichever type of prompt is supported by the dialog.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>RootDir\Filename</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>If present, this parameter contains one or both of the following:</p>
      <p><strong>RootDir</strong>: The root (starting) directory, which is assumed to be a subfolder in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path is not specified. If omitted or blank, the starting directory will be a default that might depend on the OS version (it will likely be the directory most recently selected by the user during a prior use of FileSelect).</p>
      <p><strong>Filename</strong>: The default filename to initially show in the dialog's edit field. Only the naked filename (with no path) will be shown. To ensure that the dialog is properly shown, ensure that no illegal characters are present (such as /&lt;|:").</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <pre>"C:\My Pictures\Default Image Name.gif"  <em>; Both <i>RootDir</i> and <i>Filename</i> are present.</em>
"C:\My Pictures"  <em>; Only <i>RootDir</i> is present.</em>
"My Pictures"  <em>; Only <i>RootDir</i> is present, and it's relative to the current working directory.</em>
"My File"  <em>; Only <i>Filename</i> is present (but if "My File" exists as a folder, it is assumed to be <i>RootDir</i>).</em></pre>
  </dd>

  <dt>Title</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>The title of the file-selection window. If omitted or blank, it will default to <code>"Select File - " <a href="../Variables.htm#ScriptName">A_ScriptName</a></code> (i.e. the name of the current script), unless the "D" option is present, in which case the word "File" is replaced with "Folder".</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Filter</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>Indicates which types of files are shown by the dialog.</p>
      <p>Example: Documents (*.txt)<br>
        Example: Audio (*.wav; *.mp2; *.mp3)</p>
      <p>If omitted, the filter defaults to All Files (*.*).</p>
    <p>Otherwise, the filter uses the indicated string but also provides an option for All Files (*.*) in the dialog's "files of type" drop-down list. To include more than one file extension in the filter, separate them with semicolons as illustrated in the example above.</p>
    <p>This parameter must be blank or omitted if the "D" option is present.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="Array.htm">Array</a> of <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">Strings</a></p>
<p>If multi-select is not in effect, this function returns the full path and name of the single file or folder chosen by the user, or an empty string if the user cancels the dialog.</p>
<p>If the M option (multi-select) is in effect, this function returns an array of items, where each item is the full path and name of a single file. The example at the bottom of this page demonstrates how to extract the files one by one. If the user cancels the dialog, the array is empty (has zero items).</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A file-selection dialog usually looks like this:</p>
<img src="../static/dlg_file.png" alt="FileSelect" />
<p>A GUI window may display a modal file-selection dialog by means of the <a href="Gui.htm#OwnDialogs">+OwnDialogs</a> option. A modal dialog prevents the user from interacting with the GUI window until the dialog is dismissed.</p>
<p>Known limitation: A <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a> that launches during the display of a FileSelect dialog will postpone the effect of the user's clicks inside the dialog until after the timer finishes. To work around this, avoid using timers whose subroutines take a long time to finish, or disable all timers during the dialog:</p>
<pre><a href="Thread.htm">Thread</a> "NoTimers"
SelectedFile := FileSelect()
Thread "NoTimers", false</pre>

}</pre>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Every use of <em>finally</em> must belong to (be associated with) a <a href="Try.htm">try</a> statement above it (after any optional <a href="Catch.htm">catch</a> and/or <a href="Else.htm">else</a>). A <em>finally</em> always belongs to the nearest unclaimed <em>try</em> statement above it unless a <a href="Block.htm">block</a> is used to change that behavior.</p>
<p><em>Try</em> statements behave differently depending on whether <em>catch</em> or <em>finally</em> is present. For more information, see <a href="Try.htm">Try</a>.</p>
<p><em>Goto</em>, <em>break</em>, <em>continue</em> and <em>return</em> cannot be used to exit a <em>finally</em> block, as that would require suppressing any control flow instructions within the <em>try</em> block. For example, if <em>try</em> uses <code>return 42</code>, the value 42 is returned after the finally block executes. Attempts to jump out of a <em>finally</em> block using one of these statements are detected as errors at load time where possible, or at run time otherwise.</p>
<p><em>Finally</em> statements are not executed if the script is directly terminated by any means, including the tray menu or <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Block.htm#otb">One True Brace (OTB) style</a> may optionally be used with the <em>finally</em> statement. For example:</p>
<pre>try {
    ...
} finally {

    <p>The variables in which to store the values returned by the enumerator at the beginning of each iteration. The nature of these values is defined by the enumerator, which is determined by <em>Expression</em>. These variables cannot be <a href="../Language.htm#dynamic-variables">dynamic</a>.</p>
    <p>When the loop breaks or completes, these variables are restored to their former values. If a loop variable is a <a href="../Functions.htm#ByRef">ByRef parameter</a>, the target variable is unaffected by the loop. <a href="../Functions.htm#closures">Closures</a> which reference the variable (if local) are also unaffected and will see only the value it had outside the loop.</p>
    <p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Even if defined inside the loop body, a nested function which refers to a loop variable cannot see or change the current iteration's value. Instead, pass the variable explicitly or <a href="Func.htm#Bind">bind</a> its value to a parameter.</p>
    <p>Up to 19 variables are supported, if supported by the enumerator.</p>
    <p>Variables can be omitted. For example, <code>for , value in myMap</code> calls <em>myMap</em>'s enumerator with only its second parameter, omitting its first parameter. If the enumerator is user-defined and the parameter is mandatory, an exception is thrown as usual. The parameter count passed to <a href="../Objects.htm#__Enum">__Enum</a> is 0 if there are no variables or commas; otherwise it is 1 plus the number of commas present.</p>

  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The parameter list can optionally be enclosed in parentheses. For example: <code>for (val in myarray)</code></p>
<p>The process of enumeration is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before the loop begins, <i>Expression</i> is evaluated to determine the target object.</li>
  <li>The object's <code>__Enum</code> method is called to retrieve an <a href="Enumerator.htm"><i>enumerator</i></a> object. If no such method exists, the object itself is assumed to be an enumerator object.</li>
  <li>At the beginning of each iteration, the enumerator is <a href="Enumerator.htm#Call">called</a> to retrieve the next value or pair of values. If it returns false (zero or an empty string), the loop terminates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not exactly equivalent to a for-loop, the following demonstrates this process:</p>
<pre>_enum := <i>Expression</i>
try _enum := _enum.__Enum(2)
while _enum(&amp;Value1, &amp;Value2)
{
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>As in the code above, an exception is thrown if <em>Expression</em> or __Enum yields a value which cannot be called.</p>
<p>While enumerating properties, methods or array elements, it is generally unsafe to insert or remove items of that type. Doing so may cause some items to be skipped or enumerated multiple times. One workaround is to build a list of items to remove, then use a second loop to remove the items after the first loop completes.</p>
<p>A for-loop is usually followed by a <a href="Block.htm">block</a>, which is a collection of statements that form the <em>body</em> of the loop. However, a loop with only a single statement does not require a block (an "if" and its "else" count as a single statement for this purpose). The One True Brace (OTB) style may optionally be used, which allows the open-brace to appear on the same line rather than underneath. For example: <code>for x, y in z {</code>.</p>
<p>As with all loops, <a href="Break.htm">Break</a>, <a href="Continue.htm">Continue</a> and <a href="../Variables.htm#Index">A_Index</a> may be used.</p>
<p>The loop may optionally be followed by an <a href="Else.htm">Else</a> statement, which is executed if the loop had zero iterations.</p>

<h2 id="COM_Objects">COM Objects</h2>
<p>Since <i>Value1</i> and <i>Value2</i> are passed directly to the enumerator, the values they are assigned depends on what type of object is being enumerated. For COM objects, <i>Value1</i> contains the value returned by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/oaidl/nf-oaidl-ienumvariant-next">IEnumVARIANT::Next()</a> and <i>Value2</i> contains a number which represents its <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-oaut/3fe7db9f-5803-4dc4-9d14-5425d3f5461f">variant type</a>. For example, when used with a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/x4k5wbx4(v=vs.85)">Scripting.Dictionary</a> object, each <i>Value1</i> contains a key from the dictionary and <i>Value2</i> is typically 8 for strings and 3 for integers. See <a href="ComObjType.htm">ComObjType</a> for a list of type codes.</p>
<p>When enumerating a <a href="ComObjArray.htm">SafeArray</a>, <i>Value1</i> contains the current element and <i>Value2</i> contains its variant type.</p>

<h2 id="FormatSpec">Format Specifiers</h2>
<p>Each format specifier can include the following components, in this order (without the spaces):</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Flags Width .Precision ULT Type</pre>
<p><strong>Flags</strong>: Zero or more flags from the <a href="#Flags">flag table</a> below to affect output justification and prefixes.</p>
<p><strong>Width</strong>: A decimal integer which controls the minimum width of the formatted value, in characters. By default, values are right-aligned and spaces are used for padding. This can be overridden by using the <code>-</code> (left-align) and <code class="no-highlight">0</code> (zero prefix) flags.</p>
<p><strong>.Precision</strong>: A decimal integer which controls the maximum number of string characters, decimal places, or significant digits to output, depending on the output type. It must be preceded by a decimal point. Specifying a precision may cause the value to be truncated or rounded. Output types and how each is affected by the precision value are as follows (see table below for an explanation of the different output types):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>f</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>E</code>: <em>Precision</em> specifies the number of digits after the decimal point. The default is 6.</li>
  <li><code>g</code>, <code>G</code>: <em>Precision</em> specifies the maximum number of significant digits. The default is 6.</li>
  <li><code>s</code>: <em>Precision</em> specifies the maximum number of characters to be printed. Characters in excess of this are not printed.</li>
  <li>For the integer types (<code>d</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>u</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>o</code>), <em>Precision</em> acts like <em>Width</em> with the <code class="no-highlight">0</code> prefix and a default of 1.</li>
</ul>
<p id="ULT"><b>ULT</b>: Specifies a case transformation to apply to a string value -- <b>U</b>pper, <b>L</b>ower or <b>T</b>itle. Valid only with the <code>s</code> type. For example <code>{:U}</code> or <code>{:.20Ts}</code>. Lower-case <code>l</code> and <code>t</code> are also supported, but <code>u</code> is reserved for unsigned integers.</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong>: A character from the <a href="#Types">type table</a> below indicating how the input value should be interpreted. If omitted, it defaults to <code>s</code>.</p>

  <dt>YYYYMMDD...</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>Leave this parameter blank to use the current local date and time. Otherwise, specify all or the leading part of a timestamp in the <a href="FileSetTime.htm#YYYYMMDD">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a> format.</p>
  </dd>

  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>If omitted, it defaults to the time followed by the long date, both of which will be formatted according to the current user's locale. For example: 4:55 PM Saturday, November 27, 2004</p>
    <p>Otherwise, specify one or more of the date-time formats from the tables below, along with any literal spaces and punctuation in between (commas do not need to be escaped; they can be used normally). In the following example, note that M must be capitalized: M/d/yyyy h:mm tt</p>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>This function returns the transformed version of the specified timestamp.</p>
<p>If <em>YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</em> contains a invalid date and/or time portion -- such as February 29th of a non-leap year -- the date and/or time will be omitted from the return value. Although only years between 1601 and 9999 are supported, a formatted time can still be produced for earlier years as long as the time portion is valid.</p>
<p>If <em>Format</em> contains more than 2000 characters, an empty string is returned.</p>

<h2 id="Additional_Options">Additional Options</h2>
<p>The following options can appear inside the <em>YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</em> parameter immediately after the timestamp (if there is no timestamp, they may be used alone). In the following example, note the lack of commas between the last four items:</p>
<pre>OutputVar := FormatTime("20040228 LSys D1 D4")</pre>
<p><strong>R</strong>: Reverse. Have the date come before the time (meaningful only when <em>Format</em> is blank).</p>
<p><strong>Ln</strong>: If this option is <em>not</em> present, the current user's locale is used to format the string. To use the system's locale instead, specify LSys. To use a specific locale, specify the letter L followed by a hexadecimal or decimal locale identifier (LCID). For information on how to construct an LCID, search <a href="https://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a> for the following phrase: Locale Identifiers</p>
<p><strong>Dn</strong>: Date options. Specify for <strong>n</strong> one of the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0 = Force the default options to be used. This also causes the short date to be in effect.</li>
  <li>1 = Use short date (meaningful only when <em>Format</em> is blank; not compatible with 2 and 8).</li>
  <li>2 = Use long date (meaningful only when <em>Format</em> is blank; not compatible with 1 and 8).</li>
  <li>4 = Use alternate calendar (if any).</li>
  <li>8 = Use Year-Month format (meaningful only when <em>Format</em> is blank; not compatible with 1 and 2).</li>
  <li>0x10 = Add marks for left-to-right reading order layout.</li>
  <li>0x20 = Add marks for right-to-left reading order layout.</li>
  <li>0x80000000 = Do not obey any overrides the user may have in effect for the system's default date format.</li>
  <li>0x40000000 = Use the system ANSI code page for string translation instead of the locale's code page.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tn</strong>: Time options. Specify for <strong>n</strong> one of the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0 = Force the default options to be used. This also causes minutes and seconds to be shown.</li>
  <li>1 = Omit minutes and seconds.</li>
  <li>2 = Omit seconds.</li>
  <li>4 = Omit time marker (e.g. AM/PM).</li>
  <li>8 = Always use 24-hour time rather than 12-hour time.</li>
  <li>12 = Combination of the above two.</li>
  <li>0x80000000 = Do not obey any overrides the user may have in effect for the system's default time format.</li>
  <li>0x40000000 = Use the system ANSI code page for string translation instead of the locale's code page.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Dn and Tn may be repeated to put more than one option into effect, such as this example: <code>FormatTime("20040228 D2 D4 T1 T8")</code></p>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Letters and numbers that you want to be transcribed literally from <em>Format</em> into the final string should be enclosed in single quotes as in this example: <code>"'Date:' MM/dd/yy 'Time:' hh:mm:ss tt"</code>.</p>
<p>By contrast, non-alphanumeric characters such as spaces, tabs, linefeeds (`n), slashes, colons, commas, and other punctuation do not need to be enclosed in single quotes. The exception to this is the single quote character itself: to produce it literally, use four consecutive single quotes (''''), or just two if the quote is already inside an outer pair of quotes.</p>
<p>If <em>Format</em> contains date and time elements together, they must not be intermixed. In other words, the string should be dividable into two halves: a time half and a date half. For example, a format string consisting of "hh yyyy mm" would not produce the expected result because it has a date element in between two time elements.</p>
<p>When <em>Format</em> contains a numeric day of the month (either d or dd) followed by the full month name (MMMM), the genitive form of the month name is used (if the language has a genitive form).</p>
<p>On a related note, addition, subtraction and comparison of dates and times can be performed with <a href="DateAdd.htm">DateAdd</a> and <a href="DateDiff.htm">DateDiff</a>.</p>

<p>For information about other objects which can be called like functions, see <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">Function Objects</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>Closure</code> class extends <code>Func</code> but does not define any new properties.</p>

<p>For each built-in function or function definition within the script, there is a corresponding read-only variable containing a Func object. This variable is directly used to call the function, but its value can also be read to retrieve the function itself, as a value. For example:</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Before using the scan code with a built-in function like <a href="Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> or <a href="GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a>, it must first be converted to hexadecimal format, such as by using <code>Format("sc{:X}", sc_code)</code>.

<p>If <em>KeyName</em> corresponds to a virtual key code or single character, the function attempts to map the value to a scan code by calling certain system functions which refer to the script's current keyboard layout. This may differ from the keyboard layout of the active window.</p>
<p>If <em>KeyName</em> is an ASCII letter in the range A-Z and has no mapping within the keyboard layout, the corresponding virtual key in the range vk41-vk5A is used as a fallback. This virtual key is then mapped to a scan code as described above.</p>
<p>Some keyboard layouts do not define a 1:1 mapping of virtual key codes to scan codes.

<h1>GetKeyState</h1>

<p>Checks if a keyboard key or mouse/joystick button is down or up. Also retrieves joystick status.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">IsDown := <span class="func">GetKeyState</span>(KeyName <span class="optional">, Mode</span>)</pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>KeyName</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>This can be just about any single character from the keyboard or one of the key names from the <a href="../KeyList.htm">key list</a>, such as a mouse/joystick button. Examples: B, 5, LWin, RControl, Alt, Enter, Escape, LButton, MButton, Joy1.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, an explicit virtual key code such as vkFF may be specified. This is useful in the rare case where a key has no name. The code of such a key can be determined by following the steps at the bottom of the <a href="../KeyList.htm#SpecialKeys">key list page</a>. Note that this code must be in hexadecimal.</p>
      <p><b>Known limitation:</b> This function cannot differentiate between two keys which share the same virtual key code, such as Left and NumpadLeft.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Mode</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>This parameter is ignored when retrieving joystick status.</p>
      <p>If omitted, the mode will default to that which retrieves the logical state of the key. This is the state that the OS and the active window believe the key to be in, but is not necessarily the same as the physical state.</p>
	    <p>Alternatively, one of these letters may be specified:</p>
      <p><strong>P</strong>: Retrieve the physical state (i.e. whether the user is physically holding it down). The physical state of a key or mouse button will usually be the same as the logical state unless the keyboard and/or mouse hooks are installed, in which case it will accurately reflect whether or not the user is physically holding down the key or button (as long as it was pressed down while the script was running). You can determine if your script is using the  hooks via the <a href="KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a> function or menu item. You can force the hooks to be installed by calling <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">InstallKeybdHook</a> and/or <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">InstallMouseHook</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>T</strong>: Retrieve the toggle state. For keys other than <kbd>CapsLock</kbd>, <kbd>NumLock</kbd> and <kbd>ScrollLock</kbd>, the toggle state is generally 0 when the script starts and is not synchronized between processes.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">Integer (boolean)</a>, <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Float</a>, <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#nothing">String (empty)</a></p>
<p>This function returns 1 (true) if the key is down (or toggled on) or 0 (false) if it is up (or toggled off).</p>
<p>When <em>KeyName</em> is a joystick axis such as JoyX, this function returns a <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">floating-point number</a> between 0 and 100 to indicate the joystick's position as a percentage of that axis's range of motion. This <a href="../scripts/index.htm#JoystickTest">test script</a> can be used to analyze your joystick(s).</p>
<p>When <em>KeyName</em> is JoyPOV, this function returns an <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">integer</a> between 0 and 35900. The following approximate POV values are used by many joysticks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>-1: no angle to report</li>
    <li>0: forward POV</li>
    <li>9000 (i.e. 90 degrees): right POV</li>
    <li>27000 (i.e. 270 degrees): left POV</li>
    <li>18000 (i.e. 180 degrees): backward POV</li>
</ul>
<p>When <em>KeyName</em> is a button or control of a joystick that could not be detected, this function returns an empty string.</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#ValueError">ValueError</a> is thrown if invalid parameters are detected, e.g. when <em>KeyName</em> does not exist on the current keyboard layout.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>To wait for a key or mouse/joystick button to achieve a new state, it is usually easier to use <a href="KeyWait.htm">KeyWait</a> instead of a GetKeyState loop.</p>
<p>Systems with unusual keyboard drivers might be slow to update the state of their keys, especially the toggle-state of keys like <kbd>CapsLock</kbd>. A script that checks the state of such a key immediately after it changed may use <a href="Sleep.htm">Sleep</a> beforehand to give the system time to update the key state.</p>

<p>Although the standard implementation of GetMethod has limitations as described above, if <code>Value.GetMethod(Name)</code> is used instead of <code>GetMethod(Value, Name)</code>, the object <em>Value</em> can define its own implementation of GetMethod.</p>
<p><code>GetMethod(Value, "Call", N)</code> is not the same as <code>GetMethod(Value,, N)</code>, as the Call method takes the function object itself as a parameter, and its usage may otherwise differ from that of <em>Value</em>. For instance, <code>Func.Prototype.Call</code> is a single method which applies to all built-in and user-defined functions, and as such must accept any number of parameters.</p>

<p><em>Label</em> can be a variable or expression only if parentheses are used. For example, <code>Goto MyLabel</code> and <code>Goto("MyLabel")</code> both jump to <code>MyLabel:</code>.</p>
<p>Performance is slightly reduced when using a dynamic label (that is, a variable or expression which returns a label name) because the target label must be "looked up" each time rather than only once when the script is first loaded. An error dialog will be displayed if the label does not exist. To avoid this, call <a href="IsLabel.htm">IsLabel()</a> beforehand. For example:</p>
<pre>if IsLabel(VarContainingLabelName)
    Goto(VarContainingLabelName)</pre>
<p>The use of Goto is discouraged because it generally makes scripts less readable and harder to maintain. Consider using <a href="Else.htm">Else</a>, <a href="Block.htm">Blocks</a>, <a href="Break.htm">Break</a>, and <a href="Continue.htm">Continue</a> as substitutes for Goto.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Each use of this function adds a new rule to a group. In other words,  a group consists of a set of criteria rather than a fixed list of windows. Later, when a group is used by a function such as <a href="GroupActivate.htm">GroupActivate</a>, each window on the desktop is checked against each of these criteria. If a window matches one of the criteria in the group, it is considered a match.</p>
<p>Although <a href="SetTitleMatchMode.htm">SetTitleMatchMode</a> and <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> do not directly affect the behavior of this function, they do affect the other group functions such as <a href="GroupActivate.htm">GroupActivate</a> and <a href="GroupClose.htm">GroupClose</a>. They also affect the use of ahk_group in any other function's <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm">WinTitle</a>.</p>
<p>A window group is typically used to bind together a collection of related windows, which is useful for tasks that involve many related windows, or an application that owns many subwindows. For example, if you frequently work with many instances of a graphics program or text editor, you can use <a href="GroupActivate.htm">GroupActivate</a> on a hotkey to visit each instance of that program, one at a time, without having to use alt-tab or task bar buttons to locate them.</p>
<p>Since the entries in each group need to be added only once, this function is typically used during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>. Attempts to add duplicate entries to a group are ignored.</p>
<p>To include <u>all</u> windows in a group (except the special Program Manager window), use this example:</p>
<pre>GroupAdd "AllWindows"</pre>
<p>All windowing functions can operate upon a window group by specifying <code>ahk_group MyGroupName</code> for the <em>WinTitle</em> parameter. The functions <a href="WinMinimize.htm">WinMinimize</a>, <a href="WinMaximize.htm">WinMaximize</a>, <a href="WinRestore.htm">WinRestore</a>, <a href="WinHide.htm">WinHide</a>, <a href="WinShow.htm">WinShow</a>, <a href="WinClose.htm">WinClose</a>, and <a href="WinKill.htm">WinKill</a> will act upon <strong>all</strong> the group's windows. To instead act upon only the topmost window, follow this example:</p>
<pre>WinHide WinExist("ahk_group <strong>MyGroup</strong>")</pre>
<p>By contrast, the other window functions such as <a href="WinActivate.htm">WinActivate</a> and <a href="WinExist.htm">WinExist</a> will operate only upon the topmost window of the group.</p>

    <p>If omitted, the function closes the active window and activates the oldest window in the series. To change this behavior, specify one of the following letters:</p>
    <p><strong>R:</strong> The newest window (the one most recently active) is activated, but only if no members of the group are active when the function is given. "R" is useful in cases where you temporarily switch to working on an unrelated task. When you return to the group via <a href="GroupActivate.htm">GroupActivate</a>, <a href="GroupDeactivate.htm">GroupDeactivate</a>, or GroupClose, the  window you were most recently working with is activated rather than the oldest window.</p>

  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>When the <em>Mode</em> parameter is not "A", the behavior of this function is determined by whether the previous action on <em>GroupName</em> was <a href="GroupActivate.htm">GroupActivate</a> or <a href="GroupDeactivate.htm">GroupDeactivate</a>.  If it was <a href="GroupDeactivate.htm">GroupDeactivate</a>, this function will close the active window only if it is <strong>not</strong> a member of the group (otherwise it will do nothing). If it was <a href="GroupActivate.htm">GroupActivate</a> or nothing, this function will close the active window only if it <strong>is</strong>  a member of the group (otherwise it will do nothing). This behavior allows GroupClose to be assigned to a hotkey as a companion to <em>GroupName</em>'s <a href="GroupActivate.htm">GroupActivate</a> or <a href="GroupDeactivate.htm">GroupDeactivate</a> hotkey.</p>
<p>When the active window closes, the system typically activates the next most recently active window. If the newly active window is a match for the same window specification as the window that was just closed, it is left active even though the default <em>Mode</em> would normally dictate that the <strong>oldest</strong> window should be activated next. If the newly active window is a match for <strong>any</strong> of the group's window specifications, it is left active.</p>

<p>This function is useful in cases where you have a collection of favorite windows that are almost always running. By adding these windows to a group, you can use GroupDeactivate to visit each window that isn't one of your favorites and decide whether to close it. This allows you to clean up your desktop much more quickly than doing it manually.</p>
<p>GroupDeactivate selects windows in a manner similar to the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> system hotkey. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Owned windows, such as certain dialogs and tool windows, are not evaluated. However, if the owner window is eligible for activation, the most recently active owned window is activated instead, unless the owner was active more recently. This is determined by calling <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getlastactivepopup">GetLastActivePopup</a>.</li>
  <li>Windows with the WS_EX_TOPMOST or WS_EX_NOACTIVATE styles are skipped.</li>
  <li>Windows with the WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW style but without the WS_EX_APPWINDOW style are skipped. (These windows are generally also omitted from Alt-Tab and the taskbar.)</li>
  <li>Disabled windows are skipped, unless a window it owns (such as a modal dialog) was active more recently than the window itself.</li>
  <li>Hidden or cloaked windows are skipped.</li>
  <li>The Desktop is skipped.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the taskbar is skipped due to the WS_EX_TOPMOST style, it is activated if there are no other eligible windows and the active window matches the group.</p>

    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p id="PosSize"><strong>Positioning and Sizing of Controls</strong></p>
  <p>If some dimensions and/or coordinates are omitted from <em>Options</em>, the control will be positioned relative to the previous control and/or sized automatically according to its nature and contents.</p>
  <p>The following options are supported:</p>
  <p id="R"><strong>R</strong>: Rows of text (can contain a floating point number such as R2.5). <strong>R</strong> is often preferable to specifying <strong>H</strong> (Height). If both the <strong>R</strong> and <strong>H</strong> options are present, <strong>R</strong> will take precedence. For a GroupBox, this setting is the number of controls for which to reserve space inside the box. For <a href="GuiControls.htm#DropDownList">DropDownLists</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#ComboBox">ComboBoxes</a>, and <a href="GuiControls.htm#ListBox">ListBoxes</a>, it is the number of items visible at one time inside the list portion of the control (but it is often desirable to omit both the <strong>R</strong> and <strong>H</strong> options for DropDownList and ComboBox, as the popup list will automatically take advantage of the available height of the user's desktop). For other control types, <strong>R</strong> is the number of rows of text that can visibly fit inside the control.</p>
  <p><strong>W</strong>: Width, in pixels. If omitted, the width is calculated automatically for some control types based on their contents; tab controls default to 30 times the current font size, plus 3 times the <a href="#MarginX">X-margin</a>; vertical Progress Bars default to two times the current font size; and horizontal Progress Bars, horizontal Sliders, DropDownLists, ComboBoxes, ListBoxes, GroupBoxes, Edits, and Hotkeys default to 15 times the current font size (except GroupBoxes, which multiply by 18 to provide room inside for margins).</p>
  <p><strong>H</strong>: Height, in pixels. If both the <strong>H</strong> and <strong>R</strong> options are absent, DropDownLists, ComboBoxes, ListBoxes, and empty multi-line Edit controls default to 3 rows; GroupBoxes default to 2 rows; vertical Sliders and Progress Bars default to 5 rows; horizontal Sliders default to 30 pixels (except if a thickness has been specified); horizontal Progress Bars default to 2 times the current font size; Hotkey controls default to 1 row; and Tab controls default to 10 rows. For the other control types, the height is calculated automatically based on their contents. Note that for DropDownLists and ComboBoxes, <strong>H</strong> is the combined height of the control's always-visible portion and its list portion (but even if the height is set too low, at least one item will always be visible in the list). Also, for all types of controls, specifying the number of rows via the <strong>R</strong> option is usually preferable to using <strong>H</strong> because it prevents a control from showing partial/incomplete rows of text.</p>
  <p><strong>wp+n</strong>, <strong>hp+n</strong>, <strong>wp-n</strong>, <strong>hp-n</strong> (where <strong>n</strong> is any number) can be used to set the width and/or height of a control equal to the previously added control's width or height, with an optional plus or minus adjustment. For example, <code>wp</code> would set a control's width to that of the previous control, and <code>wp-50</code> would set it equal to 50 less than that of the previous control.</p>
  <p id="XY"><strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong>: X-position, Y-position. For example, specifying <code>x0 y0</code> would position the control in the upper left corner of the window's client area, which is the area beneath the title bar and menu bar (if any).</p>
  <p id="PosPlus"><strong>x+n</strong>, <strong>y+n</strong> (where <strong>n</strong> is any number): An optional plus sign can be included to position a control relative to the right or bottom edge (respectively) of the control that was previously added. For example, specifying <code>Y+10</code> would position the control 10 pixels beneath the bottom of the previous control rather than using the standard padding distance. Similarly, specifying <code>X+10</code> would position the control 10 pixels to the right of the previous control's right edge. Since negative numbers such as <code>X-10</code> are reserved for absolute positioning, to use a negative offset, include a plus sign in front of it. For example: <code>X+-10</code>.</p>
  <p id="PosPlusMargin">For <strong>X+</strong> and <strong>Y+</strong>, the letter <strong>M</strong> can be used as a substitute for the window's current <a href="#MarginX">margin</a>. For example, <code>x+m</code> uses the right edge of the previous control plus the standard padding distance. <code>xp y+m</code> positions a control below the previous control, whereas specifying a relative X coordinate on its own (with xp or x+) would normally imply <code>yp</code> by default.</p>
  <p id="xp"><strong>xp+n</strong>, <strong>yp+n</strong>, <strong>xp-n</strong>, <strong>yp-n</strong> (where <strong>n</strong> is any number) can be used to position controls relative to the previous control's upper left corner, which is often useful for enclosing controls in a <a href="GuiControls.htm#GroupBox">GroupBox</a>.</p>
  <p id="xm"><strong>xm</strong> and <strong>ym</strong> can be used to position a control at the leftmost and topmost <a href="#MarginX">margins</a> of the window, respectively (these two may also be followed by a plus/minus sign and a number).</p>
  <p id="xs"><strong>xs</strong> and <strong>ys</strong>: these are similar to <strong>xm</strong> and <strong>ym</strong> except that they refer to coordinates that were saved by having previously added a control with the word <a href="#Section">Section</a> in its options (the first control of the window always starts a new section, even if that word isn't specified in its options). For example:</p>
  <pre>MyGui := Gui()
MyGui.Add("Edit", "w600")  <em>; Add a fairly wide edit control at the top of the window.</em>
MyGui.Add("Text", "<strong>section</strong>", "First Name:")  <em>; Save this control's position and start a new section.</em>
MyGui.Add("Text",, "Last Name:")
MyGui.Add("Edit", "<strong>ys</strong>")  <em>; Start a new column within this section.</em>
MyGui.Add("Edit")
MyGui.Show</pre>
  <p><strong>xs</strong> and <strong>ys</strong> may optionally be followed by a plus/minus sign and a number. Also, it is possible to specify both the word <a href="#Section">Section</a> and xs/ys in a control's options; this uses the previous section for itself but establishes a new section for subsequent controls.</p>
  <p>Omitting either <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong> or both is useful to make a GUI layout automatically adjust to any future changes you might make to the size of controls or font. By contrast, specifying an absolute position for every control might require you to manually shift the position of all controls that lie beneath and/or to the right of a control that is being enlarged or reduced.</p>
  <p>If both <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> are omitted, the control will be positioned beneath the previous control using a standard padding distance (the current <a href="#MarginX">margin</a>). Consecutive Text or Link controls are given additional vertical padding, so that they typically align better in cases where a column of Edit, DDL or similar-sized controls are later added to their right. To use only the standard vertical margin, specify <code>Y+M</code> or any value for X.</p>
  <p>If only one component is omitted, its default value depends on which option was used to specify the other component:</p>
  <table class="info">
    <tr><th>Specified X</th><th>Default for Y</th></tr>
    <tr><td>x<em>n</em> or xm</td><td>Beneath all previous controls (maximum Y extent plus margin).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>xs</td><td>Beneath all previous controls since the most recent use of the <a href="#Section">Section</a> option.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>x+<em>n</em> or xp+<em>nonzero</em></td><td>Same as the previous control's top edge (<a href="#xp">yp</a>).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>xp or xp+0</td><td>Below the previous control (bottom edge plus margin).</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Specified Y</th><th>Default for X</th></tr>
    <tr><td>y<em>n</em> or ym</td><td>To the right of all previous controls (maximum X extent plus margin).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ys</td><td>To the right of all previous controls since the most recent use of the <a href="#Section">Section</a> option.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>y+<em>n</em> or yp+<em>nonzero</em></td><td>Same as the previous control's left edge (<a href="#xp">xp</a>).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>yp or yp+0</td><td>To the right of the previous control (right edge plus margin).</td></tr>
  </table>
  
  <p id="Events"><strong>Storing and Responding to User Input</strong></p>
  <p id="var"><strong>V</strong>: Sets the control's <a href="GuiControl.htm#Name">Name</a>. Specify the name immediately after the letter V, which is not included in the name. For example, specifying <code><strong>v</strong>MyEdit</code> would name the control "MyEdit".</p>
  <p id="label"><strong>Events</strong>: Event handlers (such as a function which is called automatically when the user clicks or changes a control) cannot be set within the control's <em>Options</em>. Instead, <a href="#OnEvent">OnEvent</a> can be used to register a callback function or method for each event of interest.</p>
  
  <p id="OtherOptions"><strong>Controls: Common Styles and Other Options</strong></p>
  <p>Note: In the absence of a preceding sign, a plus sign is assumed; for example, <code>Wrap</code> is the same as <code>+Wrap</code>. By contrast, <code>-Wrap</code> would remove the word-wrapping property.</p>
  <p id="AltSubmit"><strong>AltSubmit</strong>: Uses alternate submit method. For DropDownList, ComboBox, ListBox and Tab, this causes <a href="#Submit">Gui.Submit</a> to store the position of the selected item rather than its text. If no item is selected, a ComboBox will still store the text of its edit field.</p>
  <p><strong>C</strong>: Color of text (has no effect on <a href="GuiControls.htm#Button">buttons</a> and <a href="GuiControls.htm#StatusBar">status bars</a>). Specify the letter C followed immediately by a color name (see <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">color chart</a>) or RGB value (the 0x prefix is optional). Examples: <code>cRed</code>, <code>cFF2211</code>, <code>c0xFF2211</code>, <code>cDefault</code>.</p>
  <p id="Disabled"><strong>Disabled</strong>: Makes an input-capable control appear in a disabled state, which prevents the user from focusing or modifying its contents. Use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Enabled">GuiCtrl.Enabled</a> to enable it later. Note: To make an Edit control read-only, specify the string <code>ReadOnly</code> instead. Also, the word Disabled may optionally be followed immediately by a 0 or 1 to indicate the starting state (0 for enabled and 1 for disabled). In other words, <code>Disabled</code> and <code>"Disabled" VarContainingOne</code> are the same.</p>
  <p><strong>Hidden</strong>: The control is initially invisible. Use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Visible">GuiCtrl.Visible</a> to show it later. The word Hidden may optionally be followed immediately by a 0 or 1 to indicate the starting state (0 for visible and 1 for hidden).  In other words, <code>Hidden</code> and <code>"Hidden" VarContainingOne</code> are the same.</p>
  <p><strong>Left</strong>: Left-justifies the control's text within its available width. This option affects the following controls: Text, Edit, Button, Checkbox, Radio, UpDown, Slider, Tab, Tab2, GroupBox, DateTime.</p>
  <p><strong>Right</strong>: Right-justifies the control's text within its available width. For checkboxes and radio buttons, this also puts the box itself on the right side of the control rather than the left. This option affects the following controls: Text, Edit, Button, Checkbox, Radio, UpDown, Slider, Tab, Tab2, GroupBox, DateTime, Link.</p>
  <p><strong>Center</strong>: Centers the control's text within its available width. This option affects the following controls: Text, Edit, Button, Checkbox, Radio, Slider, GroupBox.</p>
  <p id="Section"><strong>Section</strong>: Starts a new section and saves this control's position for later use with the <em>xs</em> and <em>ys</em> positioning options described <a href="#xs">above</a>.</p>
  <p id="Tabstop"><strong>Tabstop</strong>: Use <code>-Tabstop</code> (i.e. minus Tabstop) to have an input-capable control skipped over when the user presses <kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate.</p>
  <p id="Wrap"><strong>Wrap</strong>: Enables word-wrapping of the control's contents within its available width. Since nearly all control types start off with word-wrapping enabled, use <code>-Wrap</code> to disable word-wrapping.</p>
  <p><strong>VScroll</strong>: Provides a vertical scroll bar if appropriate for this type of control.</p>
  <p><strong>HScroll</strong>: Provides a horizontal scroll bar if appropriate for this type of control. The rest of this paragraph applies to <a href="GuiControls.htm#ListBox">ListBox</a> only. The horizontal scrolling width defaults to 3 times the width of the ListBox. To specify a different scrolling width, include a number immediately after the word HScroll. For example, <code>HScroll500</code> would allow 500 pixels of scrolling inside the ListBox. However, if the specified scrolling width is smaller than the width of the ListBox, no scroll bar will be shown (though the mere presence of <em>HScroll</em> makes it possible for the horizontal scroll bar to be added later via <code>MyScrollBar.<a href="GuiControl.htm#Opt">Opt</a>("+HScroll500")</code>, which is otherwise impossible).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Controls: Uncommon Styles and Options</strong></p>
  <p id="BackgroundTrans"><strong>BackgroundTrans</strong>: Uses a transparent background, which allows any control that lies behind a Text, Picture, or GroupBox control to show through. For example, a transparent Text control displayed on top of a Picture control would make the text appear to be part of the picture. Use <code>GuiCtrl.<a href="GuiControl.htm#Opt">Opt</a>("+Background")</code> to remove this option later. See <a href="GuiControls.htm#PicAltSubmit">Picture control's AltSubmit section</a> for more information about transparent images. Known limitation: BackgroundTrans might not work properly for controls inside a <a href="GuiControls.htm#Tab">Tab control</a> that contains a <a href="ListView.htm">ListView</a>. If a control type does not support this option, an error is thrown.</p>
  <p id="Background"><strong>Background</strong><em>Color</em>: Changes the background color of the control. Replace <em>Color</em> with a color name (see <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">color chart</a>) or RGB value (the 0x prefix is optional). Examples: <code>BackgroundSilver</code>, <code>BackgroundFFDD99</code>. If this option is not present, a <a href="GuiControls.htm#Text">Text</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#Picture">Picture</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#GroupBox">GroupBox</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#Checkbox">CheckBox</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#Radio">Radio</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#Slider">Slider</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#Tab">Tab</a> or <a href="GuiControls.htm#Link">Link</a> control initially defaults to the background color set by <a href="#BackColor">Gui.BackColor</a> (or if none or other control type, the system's default background color). Specifying <code>BackgroundDefault</code> or <code>-Background</code> applies the system's default background color. For example, a control can be restored to the default color via <code>LV.Opt("+BackgroundDefault")</code>. Using <code>+Background</code> without specifying a color reverts <code>-Background</code>. If a control type does not support this option, an error is thrown.</p>
  <p><strong>Border</strong>: Provides a thin-line border around the control. Most controls do not need this because they already have a type-specific border. When adding a border to an <em>existing</em> control, it might be necessary to increase the control's width and height by 1 pixel.</p>
  <p id="Redraw"><strong>Redraw</strong>: When used with <a href="GuiControl.htm#Opt">Opt</a>, this option enables or disables redraw (visual updates) for a control by sending it a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/gdi/wm-setredraw">WM_SETREDRAW message</a>. See <a href="GuiControl.htm#redraw-remarks">Redraw</a> for more details.</p>
  <p><strong>Theme</strong>: This option can be used to override the window's current theme setting for the newly created control. It has no effect when used on an existing control; however, this may change in a future version. See GUI's <a href="#Theme">+/-Theme</a> option for details.</p>
  <p><strong>(Unnamed Style)</strong>: Specify a plus or minus sign followed immediately by a decimal or hexadecimal <a href="../misc/Styles.htm">style number</a>. If the sign is omitted, a plus sign is assumed.</p>
  <p><strong>(Unnamed ExStyle)</strong>: Specify a plus or minus sign followed immediately by the letter E and a decimal or hexadecimal extended style number. If the sign is omitted, a plus sign is assumed. For example, <code>E0x200</code> would add the WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE style, which provides a border with a sunken edge that might be appropriate for pictures and other controls. For other extended styles not documented here (since they are rarely used), see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winmsg/extended-window-styles">Extended Window Styles | Microsoft Docs</a> for a complete list.</p></dd>

For example, with a DPI of 144 (150%), <code>MyGui.Show("w100")</code> would make the Gui 150 (100 * 1.5) pixels wide, and resizing the window to 200 pixels wide via the mouse or <a href="WinMove.htm">WinMove</a> would cause <code>MyGui.GetClientPos(,,&amp;W)</code> to set <em>W</em> to 133 (200 // 1.5). <a href="../Variables.htm#ScreenDPI">A_ScreenDPI</a> contains the system's current DPI.</p>
  <p>DPI scaling only applies to the Gui and <a href="GuiControl.htm">GuiControl</a> methods/properties, so coordinates coming directly from other sources such as ControlGetPos or WinGetPos will not work. There are a number of ways to deal with this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid using hard-coded coordinates wherever possible.  For example, use the <a href="#xp">xp</a>, <a href="#xs">xs</a>, <a href="#xm">xm</a> and <a href="#PosPlusMargin">x+m</a> options for positioning controls and specify height in <a href="#R">rows of text</a> instead of pixels.</li>
    <li>Enable (<code>MyGui.Opt("+DPIScale")</code>) and disable (<code>MyGui.Opt("-DPIScale")</code>) scaling on the fly, as needed. Changing the setting does not affect positions or sizes which have already been set.</li>
    <li>Manually scale the coordinates. For example, <code>x*(A_ScreenDPI/96)</code> converts x from logical/GUI coordinates to physical/non-GUI coordinates.</li>
  </ul>
  <p id="LastFound"><strong>LastFound</strong>: Sets the window to be the <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow">last found window</a> (though this is unnecessary in a <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Threads">GUI thread</a> because it is done automatically), which allows functions such as <a href="WinGetStyle.htm">WinGetStyle</a> and <a href="WinSetTransparent.htm">WinSetTransparent</a> to operate on it even if it is hidden (that is, <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> is not necessary). This is especially useful for changing the properties of the window before showing it. For example:</p>
  <pre>MyGui.Opt("+LastFound")
WinSetTransColor(CustomColor " 150", MyGui)
MyGui.Show()</pre>
  <p id="MaximizeBox"><strong>MaximizeBox</strong>: Enables the maximize button in the title bar. This is also included as part of <em>Resize</em> below.</p>
  <p id="MinimizeBox"><strong>MinimizeBox</strong> (present by default): Enables the minimize button in the title bar.</p>
  <p id="MinSize"><strong>MinSize</strong> and <strong>MaxSize</strong>: Determines the minimum and/or maximum size of the window, such as when the user drags its edges to resize it. Specify the word <em>MinSize</em> and/or <em>MaxSize</em> with no suffix to use the window's current size as the limit (if the window has no current size, it will use the size from the first use of <a href="#Show">Gui.Show</a>). Alternatively, append the width, followed by an X, followed by the height; for example: <code>MyGui.Opt("+Resize +MinSize640x480")</code>. The dimensions are in pixels, and they specify the size of the window's client area (which excludes borders, title bar, and <a href="#MenuBar">menu bar</a>). Specify each number as decimal, not hexadecimal.</p>
  <p>Either the width or the height may be omitted to leave it unchanged (e.g. <code>+MinSize640x</code> or <code>+MinSizex480</code>). Furthermore, Min/MaxSize can be specified more than once to use the window's current size for one dimension and an explicit size for the other. For example, <code>+MinSize +MinSize640x</code> would use the window's current size for the height and 640 for the width.</p>
  <p>If <em>MinSize</em> and <em>MaxSize</em> are never used, the operating system's defaults are used (similarly, <code>MyGui.Opt("-MinSize -MaxSize")</code> can be used to return to the defaults). Note: the window must have <a href="#Resize">+Resize</a> to allow resizing by the user.</p>
  <p id="OwnDialogs"><strong>OwnDialogs</strong>: <code>MyGui.Opt("+OwnDialogs")</code> should be specified in each <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> (such as a event handling function of a Button control) for which subsequently displayed <a href="MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a>, <a href="InputBox.htm">InputBox</a>, <a href="FileSelect.htm">FileSelect</a>, and <a href="DirSelect.htm">DirSelect</a> dialogs should be owned by the window. Such dialogs are modal, meaning that the user cannot interact with the GUI window until dismissing the dialog. By contrast, <a href="ToolTip.htm">ToolTip</a> do not become modal even though they become owned; they will merely stay always on top of their owner. In either case, any owned dialog or window is automatically destroyed when its GUI window is <a href="#Destroy">destroyed</a>.</p>
  <p>There is typically no need to turn this setting back off because it does not affect other <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a>. However, if a thread needs to display both owned and unowned dialogs, it may turn off this setting via <code>MyGui.Opt("-OwnDialogs")</code>.</p>
  <p id="Owner"><strong>Owner</strong>: Use <em>+Owner</em> to make the window owned by another. An owned window has no taskbar button by default, and when visible it is always on top of its owner. It is also automatically destroyed when its owner is destroyed. <em>+Owner</em> can be used before or after the owned window is created. There are two ways to use <em>+Owner</em>, as shown below:</p>
  <pre>MyGui.Opt("+Owner" OtherGui.Hwnd)  <em>; Make the GUI owned by <i>OtherGui</i>.</em>
MyGui.Opt("+Owner")  <em>; Make the GUI owned by <a href="../Variables.htm#ScriptHwnd">the script's main window</a> to prevent display of a taskbar button.</em></pre>
  <p><code>+Owner</code> can be immediately followed by the <a href="#Hwnd">HWND</a> of any top-level window.</p>
  <p>To prevent the user from interacting with the owner while one of its owned window is visible, disable the owner via <code>MyGui.Opt("+Disabled")</code>. Later (when the time comes to cancel or destroy the owned window), re-enable the owner via <code>MyGui.Opt("-Disabled")</code>. Do this prior to cancel/destroy so that the owner will be reactivated automatically.</p>
  <p id="Parent"><strong>Parent</strong>: Use <code>+Parent</code> immediately followed by the <a href="#Hwnd">HWND</a> of any window or control to use it as the parent of this window. To convert the GUI back into a top-level window, use <code>-Parent</code>. This option works even after the window is created.</p>
  <p>Known limitation: <a href="../Program.htm#Installer_uiAccess">Running with UI access</a> prevents the <code>+Parent</code> option from working on an existing window if the new parent is always-on-top and the child window is not.</p>
  <p id="Resize"><strong>Resize</strong>: Makes the window resizable and enables its maximize button in the title bar. To avoid enabling the maximize button, specify <code>+Resize -MaximizeBox</code>.</p>
  <p><strong>SysMenu</strong> (present by default): Specify <code>-SysMenu</code> (minus SysMenu) to omit the system menu and icon in the window's upper left corner. This will also omit the minimize, maximize, and close buttons in the title bar.</p>
  <p id="Theme"><strong>Theme</strong>: By specifying <code>-Theme</code>, all subsequently created controls in the window will have the Classic Theme appearance. To later create additional controls that obey the current theme, turn it back on via <code>+Theme</code>. Note: This option has no effect if the Classic Theme is in effect. Finally, this setting may be changed for an individual control by specifying <code>+Theme</code> or <code>-Theme</code> in its options when it is created.</p>
  <p><strong>ToolWindow</strong>: Provides a narrower title bar but the window will have no taskbar button. This always hides the maximize and minimize buttons, regardless of whether the <a href="../misc/Styles.htm#WS_MAXIMIZEBOX">WS_MAXIMIZEBOX</a> and <a href="../misc/Styles.htm#WS_MINIMIZEBOX">WS_MINIMIZEBOX</a> styles are present.</p>
  <p><strong>(Unnamed Style)</strong>: Specify a plus or minus sign followed immediately by a decimal or hexadecimal <a href="../misc/Styles.htm">style number</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>(Unnamed ExStyle)</strong>: Specify a plus or minus sign followed immediately by the letter E and a decimal or hexadecimal extended style number. For example, <code>+E0x40000</code> would add the WS_EX_APPWINDOW style, which provides a taskbar button for a window that would otherwise lack one. For other extended styles not documented here (since they are rarely used), see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winmsg/extended-window-styles">Extended Window Styles | Microsoft Docs</a> for a complete list.</p></dd>

  <p>The following words are supported: <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, <s>strike</s>, <u>underline</u>, and norm. <em>Norm</em> returns the font to normal weight/boldness and  turns off italic, strike, and underline (but it retains the existing color and size). It is possible to use norm to turn off all attributes and then selectively turn on others. For example, specifying <code>norm italic</code> would set the font to normal then to italic.</p>
  <p><strong>C</strong>: Color name (see <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">color chart</a>) or RGB value -- or specify the word Default to return to the system's default color (black on most systems). Example values: <code>cRed</code>, <code>cFFFFAA</code>, <code>cDefault</code>. Note: <a href="GuiControls.htm#Button">Buttons</a> and <a href="GuiControls.htm#StatusBar">status bars</a> do not obey custom colors. Also, an individual control can be created with a font color other than the current one by including the C option. For example: <code>MyGui.Add("Text", "cRed", "My Text")</code>.</p>

  <dt>FontName</dt><dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p><em>FontName</em> may be the name of any font, such as one from the <a href="../misc/FontsStandard.htm">font table</a>. If <em>FontName</em> is omitted or does not exist on the system, the previous font's typeface will be used (or if none, the system's default GUI typeface). This behavior is useful to make a GUI window have a similar font on multiple systems, even if some of those systems lack the preferred font. For example, by using the following methods in order, Verdana will be given preference over Arial, which in turn is given preference over MS sans serif:</p>
  <pre>MyGui.SetFont(, "MS sans serif")
MyGui.SetFont(, "Arial")
MyGui.SetFont(, "Verdana")  <em>; Preferred font.</em></pre></dd>

If there is no previous position, the window will be auto-centered in one or both dimensions if the X and/or Y options mentioned below are absent. If there is no previous size, the window will be auto-sized according to the size and positions of the controls it contains.</p>
  <p>Zero or more of the following strings may be present in <em>Options</em> (specify each number as decimal, not hexadecimal):</p>
  <p><strong>Wn</strong>: Specify for <strong>n</strong> the width (in pixels) of the window's client area (the client area excludes the window's borders, title bar, and <a href="#MenuBar">menu bar</a>).</p>
  <p><strong>Hn</strong>: Specify for <strong>n</strong> the height of the window's client area, in pixels.</p>
  <p><strong>Xn</strong>: Specify for <strong>n</strong> the window's X-position on the screen, in pixels. Position 0 is the leftmost column of pixels visible on the screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Yn</strong>: Specify for <strong>n</strong> the window's Y-position on the screen, in pixels. Position 0 is the topmost row of pixels visible on the screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Center</strong>: Centers the window horizontally and vertically on the screen.</p>
  <p><strong>xCenter</strong>: Centers the window horizontally on the screen. For example: <code>MyGui.Show("xCenter y0")</code>.</p>
  <p><strong>yCenter</strong>: Centers the window vertically on the screen.</p>
  <p id="AutoSize"><strong>AutoSize</strong>: Resizes the window to accommodate only its currently visible controls. This is useful to resize the window after new controls are added, or  existing controls are resized, hidden, or unhidden. For example: <code>MyGui.Show("AutoSize Center")</code>.</p>
  <p><em><strong>One of the following may also be present:</strong></em></p>
  <p><strong>Minimize</strong>: Minimizes the window and activates the one beneath it.</p>
  <p><strong>Maximize</strong>: Maximizes and activates the window.</p>
  <p><strong>Restore</strong>: Unminimizes or unmaximizes the window, if necessary. The window is also shown and activated, if necessary.</p>
  <p><strong>NoActivate</strong>: Unminimizes or unmaximizes the window, if necessary. The window is also shown without activating it.</p>
  <p><strong>NA</strong>: Shows the window without activating it. If the window is minimized, it will stay that way but will probably rise higher in the z-order (which is the order seen in the alt-tab selector). If the window was previously hidden, this will probably cause it to appear on top of the active window even though the active window is not deactivated.</p>
  <p><strong>Hide</strong>: Hides the window and activates the one beneath it. This is identical in function to <a href="#Hide">Gui.Hide</a> except that it allows a hidden window to be moved or resized without showing it. For example: <code>MyGui.Show("Hide x55 y66 w300 h200")</code>.</p></dd>

<p><em>RetrievedColor</em> is a 6-digit RGB value of the current color previously set by this property, or an empty string if the default color is being used.</p>
<p><em>NewColor</em> is one of the 16 primary <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">HTML color names</a>, a hexadecimal RGB color value (the 0x prefix is optional), a pure numeric RGB color value, or the word Default (or an empty string) for its default color. Example values: <code>"Silver"</code>, <code>"FFFFAA"</code>, <code>0xFFFFAA</code>, <code>"Default"</code>, <code>""</code>.</p>
<p>By default, the window's background color is the system's color for the face of buttons.</p>
<p>The color of the <a href="#MenuBar">menu bar</a> and its submenus can be changed as in this example: <code>MyMenuBar.<a href="Menu.htm#SetColor">SetColor</a> "White"</code>.</p>
<p>To make the background transparent, use <a href="WinSetTransColor.htm">WinSetTransColor</a>. However, if you do this without first having assigned a custom window via <a href="#BackColor">Gui.BackColor</a>, buttons will also become transparent. To prevent this, first assign a custom color and then make that color transparent. For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.BackColor := "EEAA99"
WinSetTransColor("EEAA99", MyGui)</pre>
<p>To additionally remove the border and title bar from a window with a transparent background, use the following: <code>MyGui.Opt("-Caption")</code></p>

Finally, the margin is taken into account by the first use of <a href="#Show">Gui.Show</a> to calculate the window's size (when no explicit size is specified).</p>
<p>By default, this margin is proportional to the size of the currently selected <a href="#SetFont">font</a> (1.25 times font-height for left &amp; right).</p>

MyGui.Show "w300 h200"</pre>
<p>In the first line above, notice that <code>&amp;Open</code> is followed by <code>Ctrl+O</code> (with a tab character in between). This indicates a keyboard shortcut that the user may press instead of selecting the menu item. If the shortcut uses only the standard modifier key names Ctrl, Alt and Shift, it is automatically registered as a <em>keyboard accelerator</em> for the GUI. Single-character accelerators with no modifiers are case-sensitive and can be triggered by unusual means such as IME or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+NNNN.</p>
<p>If a particular key combination does not work automatically, the use of a <a href="_HotIf.htm">context-sensitive hotkey</a> may be required. However, such hotkeys typically cannot be triggered by <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> and are more likely to interfere with other scripts than a standard keyboard accelerator.</p>
<p>To remove a window's current menu bar, use <code>MyGui.MenuBar := ""</code> (that is, assign an empty string).</p>

</div>

<h2 id="Navigate">Keyboard Navigation</h2>
<p>A GUI window may be navigated via <kbd>Tab</kbd>, which moves keyboard focus to the next input-capable control (controls from which the <a href="#Tabstop">Tabstop</a> style has been removed are skipped). The order of navigation is determined by the order in which the controls were originally added. When the window is shown for the first time, the first input-capable control that has the Tabstop style (which most control types have by default) will have keyboard focus, unless that control is a Button and there is a Default button, in which case the latter is focused instead.</p>
<p id="ShortcutKey">Certain controls may contain an ampersand (&amp;) to create a keyboard shortcut, which might be displayed in the control's text as an underlined character (depending on system settings). A user activates the shortcut by holding down <kbd>Alt</kbd> then typing the corresponding character. For buttons, checkboxes,  and radio buttons, pressing the shortcut is the same as clicking the control. For GroupBoxes and Text controls, pressing the shortcut causes keyboard focus to jump to the first input-capable <a href="#Tabstop">tabstop</a> control that was created after it. However, if more than one control has the same shortcut key, pressing the shortcut will alternate keyboard focus among all controls with the same shortcut.</p>
<p>To display a literal ampersand inside the control types mentioned above, specify two consecutive ampersands as in this example: <code>MyGui.Add("Button",, "Save &amp;&amp; Exit")</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Appear">Window Appearance</h2>
<p>For its icon, a GUI window uses the tray icon that was in effect at the time the window was created. Thus, to have a different icon, change the tray icon before creating the window. For example: <code><a href="TraySetIcon.htm">TraySetIcon</a>("MyIcon.ico")</code>. It is also possible to have a different large icon for a window than its small icon (the large icon is displayed in the alt-tab task switcher). This can be done via <a href="LoadPicture.htm">LoadPicture</a> and <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>; for example:</p>
<pre>iconsize := 32  <em>; Ideal size for alt-tab varies between systems and OS versions.</em>
hIcon := LoadPicture("My Icon.ico", "Icon1 w" iconsize " h" iconsize, &amp;imgtype)
MyGui := Gui()
SendMessage(0x0080, 1, hIcon, MyGui)  <em>; 0x0080 is WM_SETICON; and 1 means ICON_BIG (vs. 0 for ICON_SMALL).</em>
MyGui.Show()</pre>
<p>Due to OS limitations, Checkboxes, Radio buttons, and GroupBoxes for which a non-default text color was specified will take on the Classic Theme appearance.</p>
<p>Related topic: <a href="#MarginX">window's margin</a>.</p>

<h2 id="GenRemarks">General Remarks</h2>
<p>Use the <a href="GuiControl.htm">GuiControl object</a> to operate upon individual controls in a GUI window.</p>
<p>Each GUI window may have up to 11,000 controls. However, use caution when creating more than 5000 controls because system instability may occur for certain control types.</p>
<p id="deleted">The GUI window is automatically <a href="#Destroy">destroyed</a> when the Gui object is deleted, which occurs when its <a href="../Objects.htm#Reference_Counting">reference count</a> reaches zero. However, this does not typically occur while the window is visible, as <a href="#Show">Show</a> automatically increments the reference count. While the window is visible, the user can interact with it and raise events which are handled by the script. When the user closes the window or it is hidden by <a href="#Hide">Hide</a>, <a href="#Show">Show</a> or <a href="#Submit">Submit</a>, this extra reference is released.</p>
<p>To keep a GUI window "alive" without calling <a href="#Show">Show</a> or retaining a reference to its Gui object, the script can increment the object's reference count with <a href="ObjAddRef.htm">ObjAddRef</a> (in which case <a href="ObjAddRef.htm">ObjRelease</a> must be called when the window is no longer needed). For example, this might be done when using a hidden GUI window to <a href="OnMessage.htm">receive messages</a>, or if the window is shown by "external" means such as <a href="WinShow.htm">WinShow</a> (by this script or any other).</p>
<p>If the script is not <a href="../Scripts.htm#persistent">persistent</a> for any other reason, it will exit after the last visible GUI is closed; either when the last thread completes or immediately if no threads are running.</p>

    <p>This parameter should be 1 for the first entry, 2 for the second, etc.</p>
    <p>If <em>Value</em> is a string (even a numeric string), the entry whose leading part matches <em>Value</em> will be selected. The search is not case sensitive. For example, if the control contains the item "UNIX Text", specifying the word unix (lowercase) would be enough to select it. For a <a href="GuiControls.htm#ListBoxMulti">multi-select ListBox</a>, all matching items are selected.</p>
    <p>If <em>Value</em> is zero or empty, the current selection is removed.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>To select or deselect <u>all</u> items in a <a href="GuiControls.htm#ListBoxMulti">multi-select ListBox</a>, follow this example:</p>
<pre>PostMessage 0x0185, 1, -1, ListBox  <em>; Select all items. 0x0185 is LB_SETSEL.</em>
PostMessage 0x0185, 0, -1, ListBox  <em>; Deselect all items.</em>
ListBox.Choose(0)  <em>; Deselect all items.</em></pre>
<p>Unlike <a href="ControlChooseIndex.htm">ControlChooseIndex</a>, this method does not raise a <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> or <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#DoubleClick">DoubleClick</a> event.</p>

<div class="methodShort" id="Delete">
<h3>Delete</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Value</dt><dd>

    <p>This parameter should be 1 for the first entry, 2 for the second, etc. If omitted, all entries are deleted.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>For tab controls, you should note that a tab's sub-controls stay associated with their original tab number; that is, they are never associated with their tab's actual display-name. For this reason, renaming or removing a tab will not change the tab number to which the sub-controls belong. For example, if there are three tabs <code>["Red","Green","Blue"]</code> and the second tab is removed by means of <code>MyTab.Delete(2)</code>, the sub-controls originally associated with Green will now be associated with Blue. Because of this behavior, only tabs at the end should generally be removed. Tabs that are removed in this way can be added back later, at which time they will reclaim their original set of controls.</p>

</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="Name">

<p>Retrieves or sets the name of the control.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">RetrievedName := GuiCtrl.Name</pre>
<pre class="Syntax">GuiCtrl.Name := NewName</pre>
<p>The control's name can be used with <a href="Gui.htm#__Item">Gui.__Item</a> to retrieve the GuiControl object. For most input-capable controls, the name is also used by <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">Gui.Submit</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="Text">
<h3>Text</h3>
<p>Retrieves or sets the text/caption of the control.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">RetrievedText := GuiCtrl.Text</pre>
<pre class="Syntax">GuiCtrl.Text := NewText</pre>
<p>Note: If the control has no visible caption text and no (single) text value, this property corresponds to the control's hidden caption text (like <a href="ControlGetText.htm">ControlGetText</a>/<a href="ControlSetText.htm">ControlSetText</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Caption/display text</strong>: The <em>Text</em> property retrieves or sets the caption/display text of the following control types: <a href="GuiControls.htm#Button">Button</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#Checkbox">Checkbox</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#Edit">Edit</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#GroupBox">GroupBox</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#Link">Link</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#Radio">Radio</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#Text">Text</a>. Since the control will not expand automatically, use <code>GuiCtrl.<a href="#Move">Move</a>("w300")</code> or similar if the control needs to be widened.</p>

<p><strong><a href="GuiControls.htm#DateTime">DateTime</a></strong>: The <em>Text</em> property retrieves the formatted text displayed by the control. Assigning a formatted date/time string to the control is not supported. To change the date/time being displayed, assign <a href="#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> a date-time stamp in <a href="FileSetTime.htm#YYYYMMDD">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a> format.</p>

<p><strong><a href="GuiControls.htm#Edit">Edit</a></strong>: As with other controls, the text is retrieved or set as-is; no end-of-line translation is performed. To retrieve or set the text of a multi-line Edit control while also translating between <code>`r`n</code> and <code>`n</code>, use <a href="#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="GuiControls.htm#StatusBar">StatusBar</a></strong>: The <em>Text</em> property retrieves or sets the text of the first part only (use <a href="GuiControls.htm#SB_SetText">SB.SetText</a> for greater flexibility).</p>

<p><strong>List item text</strong>: The <em>Text</em> property retrieves or sets the currently selected item/tab for the following control types: <a href="GuiControls.htm#Tab">Tab</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#DropDownList">DropDownList</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#ComboBox">ComboBox</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#ListBox">ListBox</a>.</p>
<p><em>NewText</em> should be the full text (case insensitive) of the item/tab to select.</p>
<p>For a ComboBox, if there is no selected item, the text in the control's edit field is retrieved instead. For other controls, <em>RetrievedText</em> is empty/blank. Similarly, if <em>NewText</em> is empty/blank, the current item/tab will be deselected.</p>
<p>For a <a href="GuiControls.htm#ListBoxMulti">multi-select ListBox</a>, <em>RetrievedText</em> is an array. <em>NewText</em> cannot be an array, but if multiple items match, they are all selected. To select multiple items with different text, call <a href="#Choose">GuiCtrl.Choose</a> repeatedly.</p>
<p>To select an item by its position number instead of its text, use <a href="#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="Type">
<h3>Type</h3>
<p>Retrieves the type of the control.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">RetrievedType := GuiCtrl.Type</pre>
<p>Depending on the <a href="GuiControls.htm">control type</a>, <var>RetrievedType</var> is one of the following strings: Text, Edit, UpDown, Pic, Button, CheckBox, Radio, DDL, ComboBox, ListBox, ListView, TreeView, Link, Hotkey, DateTime, MonthCal, Slider, Progress, GroupBox, Tab, Tab2, Tab3, StatusBar, ActiveX, Custom.</p>
</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="Value">
<h3>Value</h3>
<p>Retrieves or sets the contents of a control.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">RetrievedValue := GuiCtrl.Value</pre>
<pre class="Syntax">GuiCtrl.Value := NewValue</pre>
  <p>Note: If the control is not value-capable, <em>RetrievedValue</em> will be blank and assigning <em>NewValue</em> will raise an error. Invalid values throw an exception.</p>
  <p>Following control types are value-capable:</p>

<p><strong>Picture</strong></p>
<p><em>RetrievedValue</em> is the picture's file name as it was originally specified when the <a href="GuiControls.htm#Picture">Picture</a> control was created. This name does not change even if a new picture file name is specified.</p>
<p><em>NewValue</em> is the filename (or <a href="../misc/ImageHandles.htm">handle</a>) of the new image to load (see <a href="GuiControls.htm#Picture">Picture</a> for supported file types). Zero or more of the following options may be specified immediately in front of the filename: <code>*wN</code> (width N), <code>*hN</code> (height N), and <code>*IconN</code> (icon group number N in a DLL or EXE file).  In the following example, the default icon from the second icon group is loaded with a width of 100 and an automatic height via "keep aspect ratio": <code>MyPic.Value := "*icon2 *w100 *h-1 C:\My Application.exe"</code>. Specify <code>*w0 *h0</code> to use the image's actual width and height. If <code>*w</code> and <code>*h</code> are omitted, the image will be scaled to fit the current size of the control. When loading from a multi-icon .ICO file, specifying a width and height also determines which icon to load. Note: Use only one space or tab between the final option and the filename itself; any other spaces and tabs are treated as part of the filename.</p>

<p><strong>Text</strong></p>
<p><em>RetrievedValue</em> is the text/caption of the <a href="GuiControls.htm#Text">Text</a> control.</p>
<p><em>NewValue</em> is the control's new text. Since the control will not expand automatically, use <code>GuiCtrl.<a href="#Move">Move</a>("w300")</code> if the control needs to be widened.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p><em>RetrievedValue</em> is the current content of the <a href="GuiControls.htm#Edit">Edit</a> control. For multi-line controls, any line breaks in the text will be represented as plain linefeeds (`n) rather than the traditional CR+LF (`r`n) used by non-GUI functions such as <a href="ControlGetText.htm">ControlGetText</a> and <a href="ControlSetText.htm">ControlSetText</a>.</p>
<p><em>NewValue</em> is the new content. For multi-line controls, Any linefeeds (`n) in <em>NewValue</em> that lack a preceding carriage return (`r) are automatically translated to CR+LF (`r`n) to make them display properly. However, this is usually not a concern because when using <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">Gui.Submit</a> or when retrieving this value this translation will be reversed automatically by replacing CR+LF with LF (`n).</p>
  <p>To retrieve or set the text without translating `n to or from `r`n, use <a href="#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Hotkey</strong></p>
<p><em>RetrievedValue</em> is the modifiers and key name if there is a hotkey in the <a href="GuiControls.htm#Hotkey">Hotkey</a> control; otherwise blank. Examples: <code>^!C</code>, <code>^Home</code>, <code>+^NumpadHome</code>.</p>
<p><em>NewValue</em> can be a set of modifiers with a key name, or blank to clear the control. Examples: <code>^!c</code>, <code>^Numpad1</code>, <code>+Home</code>. The only modifiers supported are ^ (Ctrl), ! (Alt), and + (Shift). See the <a href="../KeyList.htm">key list</a> for available key names.</p>

<p><strong>Checkbox / Radio</strong></p>
<p><em>RetrievedValue</em> is 1 if the <a href="GuiControls.htm#Checkbox">Checkbox</a> or <a href="GuiControls.htm#Radio">Radio</a> control is checked, 0 if it is unchecked, or -1 if it has a gray checkmark.</p>
<p><em>NewValue</em> can be 0 to uncheck the button, 1 to check it, or -1 to give it a gray checkmark. For Radio buttons,  if one is being checked (turned on) and it is a member of a multi-radio group, the other radio buttons in its group will be automatically unchecked.</p>
  <p>To get or set control's text/caption instead, use <a href="#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a>.</p>

<p><strong>DateTime / MonthCal</strong></p>
<p><em>RetrievedValue</em> is a date-time stamp in <a href="FileSetTime.htm#YYYYMMDD">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a> format currently selected in the <a href="GuiControls.htm#DateTime">DateTime</a> or <a href="GuiControls.htm#MonthCal">MonthCal</a> control.</p>
<p><em>NewValue</em> is a date-time stamp in <a href="FileSetTime.htm#YYYYMMDD">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a> format. Specify <code>A_Now</code> to use the current date and time (today). For DateTime controls, <em>NewValue</em> may be an empty string to cause the control to have no date/time selected (if it was created with <a href="GuiControls.htm#ChooseNone">that ability</a>). For MonthCal controls, a range may be specified if the control is <a href="GuiControls.htm#MonthCalMulti">multi-select</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UpDown / Slider / Progress</strong></p>
<p><em>RetrievedValue</em> is the current position of the <a href="GuiControls.htm#UpDown">UpDown</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#Slider">Slider</a> or <a href="GuiControls.htm#Progress">Progress</a> control.</p>
<p><em>NewValue</em> is the new position of the control, for example <code>MySlider.Value := 10</code>. To adjust the value by a relative amount, use the operators <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>++</code> or <code>--</code> instead of <code>:=</code>. If the new position would be outside the range of the control, the control is generally set to the nearest valid value.</p>

<p><strong>Tab / DropDownList / ComboBox / ListBox</strong></p>
<p><em>RetrievedValue</em> is the position of the currently selected item/tab in the <a href="GuiControls.htm#Tab">Tab</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#DropDownList">DropDownList</a>, <a href="GuiControls.htm#ComboBox">ComboBox</a> or <a href="GuiControls.htm#ListBox">ListBox</a> control. If none is selected, zero is returned. If text is entered into a ComboBox, the first item with matching text is used. If there is no matching item, the result is zero even if there is text in the control. For a <a href="GuiControls.htm#ListBoxMulti">multi-select ListBox</a>, the result is an array of numbers (which is empty if no items are selected).</p>
<p><em>NewValue</em> is the position of a single item/tab to select, or zero to clear the current selection (this is valid even for Tab controls). To select multiple items, call <a href="#Choose">GuiCtrl.Choose</a> repeatedly.</p>
<p>To get or set the selected item given its text instead of its position, use <a href="#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a>.</p>

<p><strong>ActiveX</strong></p>
<p><em>RetrievedValue</em> is the ActiveX object of the <a href="GuiControls.htm#ActiveX">ActiveX</a> control. For example, if the control was created with the text <em>Shell.Explorer</em>, this is a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa752043(v=vs.85)">WebBrowser</a> object. The same <a href="ComValue.htm">wrapper object</a> is returned each time.</p>
</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="Visible">
<h3>Visible</h3>
<p>Retrieves the current visibility state of the control, or shows or hides it.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">RetrievedState := GuiCtrl.Visible</pre>
<pre class="Syntax">GuiCtrl.Visible := NewState</pre>
<p>For Tab controls, this will also show or hide all of the tab's sub-controls. If you additionally want to prevent a control's shortcut key (underlined letter) from working, disable the control via <code>GuiCtrl.Enabled := false</code>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="GenRemarks">General Remarks</h2>

<h3 id="redraw-remarks">Redraw</h3>
<p>When adding a large number of items to a control (such as a <a href="ListView.htm">ListView</a>, <a href="TreeView.htm">TreeView</a> or <a href="GuiControls.htm#ListBox">ListBox</a>), performance can be improved by preventing the control from being redrawn while the changes are being made. This is done by using <code>GuiCtrl.Opt("-Redraw")</code> before adding the items and <code>GuiCtrl.Opt("+Redraw")</code> afterward. Changes to the control which have not yet become visible prior to disabling redraw will generally not become visible until after redraw is re-enabled.</p>
<p>For performance reasons, changes to a control's content generally do not cause the control to be immediately redrawn even if redraw is enabled. Instead, a portion of the control is "invalidated" and is usually repainted after a brief delay, when the program checks its internal message queue. The script can force this to take place immediately by calling <code>Sleep -1</code>.</p>

<p>If a width (W) is specified in <em>Options</em> but no <a href="Gui.htm#R">rows (R)</a> or height (H), the text will be word-wrapped as needed, and the control's height will be set automatically.</p>

<p>To detect when the user clicks the text, use the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Click">Click event</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui := Gui()
FakeLink := MyGui.Add("Text", "", "Click here to launch Google.")
FakeLink.SetFont("underline cBlue")
FakeLink.OnEvent("Click", LaunchGoogle)

<em>; Alternatively, a <a href="#Link">Link</a> control can be used:</em>
MyGui.Add("Link",, 'Click &lt;a href="www.google.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to launch Google.')
MyGui.Show()

LaunchGoogle(*) {
    Run("www.google.com")
}</pre>
<p>Text controls also support the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#DoubleClick">DoubleClick event</a>.</p>
<p id="SS_NOTIFY">Only Text controls with the SS_NOTIFY (0x100) style send click and double-click notifications, so <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm">OnEvent</a> automatically adds this style when a Click or DoubleClick callback is registered. The SS_NOTIFY style causes the OS to automatically copy the control's text to the clipboard when it is double-clicked.</p>
<p>An ampersand (&amp;) may be used in the text to underline one of its letters. For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Text",, "&amp;First Name:")
MyGui.Add("Edit")</pre>
<p>In the example above, the letter F will be underlined, which allows the user to press the <a href="Gui.htm#ShortcutKey">shortcut key</a> <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> to set keyboard focus to the first input-capable control that was added after the text control. To instead display a literal ampersand, specify two consecutive ampersands (&amp;&amp;). To disable all special treatment of ampersands, include <a href="../misc/Styles.htm#SS_NOPREFIX">0x80</a> in the control's options.</p>
<p>See <a href="Gui.htm#OtherOptions">general options</a> for other options like <em>Right</em>, <em>Center</em>, and <em>Hidden</em>. See also: <a href="Gui.htm#PosSize">position and sizing of controls</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Edit">Edit</h2>
<p>Description: An area where free-form text can be typed by the user.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Edit", "r9 vMyEdit w135", "Text to appear inside the edit control (omit this parameter to start off empty).")</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddEdit("r9 vMyEdit w135", "Text to appear inside the edit control (omit this parameter to start off empty).")</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_edit.png" alt="Edit" />
<p>The control will be multi-line if it has more than one row of text. For example, specifying <code>r3</code> in <em>Options</em> will create a 3-line edit control with the following default properties: a vertical scroll bar, word-wrapping enabled, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> captured as part of the input rather than triggering the window's <a href="#DefaultButton">default button</a>.</p>
<p>To start a new line in a multi-line edit control, the last parameter (contents) may contain either a solitary linefeed (`n) or a carriage return and linefeed (`r`n). Both methods produce literal `r`n pairs inside the Edit control. However, when the control's content is retrieved via <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a>, each `r`n in the text is always translated to a plain linefeed (`n). To bypass this End-of-Line translation, use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a>. To write the text to a file, follow this example: <code><a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a>(MyEdit.Text, "C:\Saved File.txt")</code>.</p>
<p>If the control has word-wrapping enabled (which is the default for multi-line edit controls), any wrapping that occurs as the user types will not produce linefeed characters (only <kbd>Enter</kbd> can do that).</p>
<p>Whenever the user changes the control's content, the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> event is raised.</p>
<p>TIP: To load a text file into an Edit control, use <a href="FileRead.htm">FileRead</a> and <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>MyEdit := MyGui.Add("Edit", "R20")
MyEdit.Value := FileRead("C:\My File.txt")</pre>

<h3 id="Edit_Options">Edit Options</h3>
<p>To remove an option rather than adding it, precede it with a minus sign:</p>
<p><strong>Limit</strong>: Restricts the user's input to the visible width of the edit field. Alternatively, to limit input to a specific number of characters, include a number immediately afterward. For example, <code>Limit10</code> would allow no more than 10 characters to be entered.</p>
<p><strong>Lowercase</strong>: The characters typed by the user are automatically converted to lowercase.</p>
<p id="EditMulti"><strong>Multi</strong>: Makes it possible to have more than one line of text. However, it is usually not necessary to specify this because it will be auto-detected based on height (H), <a href="Gui.htm#R">rows (R)</a>, or contents (<em>Text</em>).</p>
<p id="EditNum"><strong>Number</strong>: Prevents the user from typing anything other than digits into the field (however, it is still possible to paste non-digits into it). An alternate way of forcing a numeric entry is to attach an <a href="#UpDown">UpDown</a> control to the Edit.</p>
<p><strong>Password</strong>: Hides the user's input (such as for password entry) by substituting masking characters for what the user types. If a non-default masking character is desired, include it immediately after the word Password. For example, <code>Password*</code> would make the masking character an asterisk rather than the black circle (bullet). Note: This option has no effect for multi-line edit controls.</p>
<p><strong>ReadOnly</strong>: Prevents the user from changing the control's contents. However, the text can still be scrolled, selected and copied to the clipboard.</p>
<p><strong>Tn</strong>: The letter T may be used to set tab stops inside a <a href="#EditMulti">multi-line edit control</a> (since tab stops determine the column positions to which literal TAB characters will jump, they can be used to format the text into columns). If the letter T is not used, tab stops are set at every 32 dialog units (the width of each "dialog unit" is determined by the operating system). If the letter T is used only once, tab stops are set at every <strong>n</strong> units across the entire width of the control. For example, <code>MyGui.Add("Edit", "vMyEdit r16 t64")</code> would double the default distance between tab stops. To have custom tab stops, specify the letter T multiple times as in the following example: <code>MyGui.Add("Edit", "vMyEdit r16 t8 t16 t32 t64 t128")</code>. One tab stop is set for each of the absolute column positions in the list, up to a maximum of 50 tab stops. Note: Tab stops require a multiline edit control.</p>
<p><strong>Uppercase</strong>: The characters typed by the user are automatically converted to uppercase.</p>
<p><strong>WantCtrlA</strong>: Specify <code>-WantCtrlA</code> (minus WantCtrlA) to prevent the user's press of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> from selecting all text in the edit control.</p>
<p id="WantReturn"><strong>WantReturn</strong>: Specify <code>-WantReturn</code> (minus WantReturn) to prevent a multi-line edit control from capturing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will then be the same as pressing the window's <a href="#DefaultButton">default button</a> (if any). In this case, the user may press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to start a new line.</p>
<p><strong>WantTab</strong>: Causes <kbd>Tab</kbd> to produce a tab character rather than navigating to the next control. Without this option, the user may press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to produce a tab character inside a multi-line edit control. Note: <em>WantTab</em> also works in a single-line edit control.</p>
<p><strong>Wrap</strong>: Specify <code>-Wrap</code> (minus Wrap) to turn off word-wrapping in a multi-line edit control. Since this style cannot be changed after the control has been created, use one of the following to change it: 1) <a href="Gui.htm#Destroy">Destroy</a> then recreate the window and its control; or 2) Create two overlapping edit controls, one with wrapping enabled and the other without it. The one not currently in use can be kept empty and/or hidden.</p>
<p>See <a href="Gui.htm#OtherOptions">general options</a> for other options like <em>Right</em>, <em>Center</em>, and <em>Hidden</em>. See also: <a href="Gui.htm#PosSize">position and sizing of controls</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A more powerful edit control</strong>: HiEdit is a free, multitabbed, large-file edit control consuming very little memory. It can edit both text and binary files. For details and a demonstration, see <a href="https://github.com/majkinetor/mm-autohotkey/tree/master/HiEdit">HiEdit on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="UpDown">UpDown</h2>
<p>Description: A pair of arrow buttons that the user can click to increase or decrease a value. By default, an UpDown control automatically snaps onto the previously added control. This previous control is known as the UpDown's <em>buddy control</em>. The most common example is a "spinner", which is an UpDown attached to an <a href="#Edit">Edit control</a>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Edit")
MyGui.Add("UpDown", "vMyUpDown Range1-10", 5)</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddEdit()
MyGui.AddUpDown("vMyUpDown Range1-10", 5)</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_updown.png" alt="UpDown" />
<p>In the example above, the Edit control is the UpDown's buddy control. Whenever the user presses one of the arrow buttons, the number in the Edit control is automatically increased or decreased.</p>
<p>An UpDown's buddy control can also be a <a href="#Text">Text control</a> or <a href="#ListBox">ListBox</a>. However, due to OS limitations, controls other than these (such as ComboBox and DropDownList) might not work properly with the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> event and other features.</p>
<p>Specify the UpDown's starting position as the last parameter (if omitted, it starts off at 0 or the number in the allowable range that is closest to 0).</p>
<p>When <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> is used, the return value is the current numeric position of the UpDown. If the UpDown is attached to an Edit control and you do not wish to validate the user's input, it is best to use the UpDown's value rather than the Edit's. This is because the UpDown will always yield an in-range number, even when the user has typed something non-numeric or out-of-range in the Edit control. On a related note, numbers with more than three digits get a <a href="../misc/Styles.htm#UpDownSep">thousands separator</a> (such as comma) by default. These separators are returned by the Edit control but not by the UpDown control.</p>
<p>Whenever the user clicks one of the arrow buttons or presses an arrow key on the keyboard, the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> event is raised.</p>

<h3 id="UpDown_Options">UpDown Options</h3>
<p id="Horz"><strong>Horz</strong>: Make's the control's buttons point left/right rather than up/down. By default, <em>Horz</em> also makes the control isolated (no buddy). This can be overridden by specifying <code>Horz 16</code> in the control's options.</p>
<p><strong>Left</strong>: Puts the UpDown on the left side of its buddy rather than the right.</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>: Sets the range to be something other than 0 to 100. After the word Range, specify the minimum, a dash, and maximum. For example, <code>Range1-1000</code> would allow a number between 1 and 1000 to be selected; <code>Range-50-50</code> would allow a number between -50 and 50; and <code>Range-10--5</code> would allow a number between -10 and -5. The minimum and maximum may be swapped to cause the arrows to move in the opposite of their normal direction. The broadest allowable range is -2147483648-2147483647. Finally, if the buddy control is a <a href="#ListBox">ListBox</a>, the range defaults to 32767-0 for verticals and the inverse for horizontals (<a href="#Horz">Horz</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Wrap</strong>: Causes the control to wrap around to the other end of its range when the user attempts to go beyond the minimum or maximum. Without <em>Wrap</em>, the control stops when the minimum or maximum is reached.</p>
<p><strong>16</strong>: Specify -16 (minus 16) to cause a vertical UpDown to be isolated; that is, it will have no buddy. This also causes the control to obey any specified width, height, and position rather than conforming to the size of its buddy control. In addition, an isolated UpDown tracks its own position internally. This position can be retrieved normally by means such as <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a>.</p>
<p id="UpDownSep"><strong>0x80</strong>: Include <code>0x80</code> in <em>Options</em> to omit the thousands separator that is normally present between every three decimal digits in the buddy control. However, this style is normally not used because the separators are omitted from the number whenever the script retrieves it from the UpDown control itself (rather than its buddy control).</p>
<p><strong>Increments other than 1</strong>: In <a href="http://numeric.nerim.net/AutoHotkey/Scripts/UpDown%20-%20Non-unitary%20increments.ahk">this script</a>, NumEric demonstrates how to change an UpDown's increment to a value other than 1 (such as 5 or 0.1).</p>
<p><strong>Hexadecimal number format</strong>: The number format displayed inside the buddy control may be changed from decimal to hexadecimal by following this example:</p>
<pre>SendMessage 0x046D, 16, 0, "msctls_updown321" <em>; 0x046D is UDM_SETBASE</em></pre>
<p>However, this affects only the buddy control, not the UpDown's reported position.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="Gui.htm#PosSize">position and sizing of controls</a>.</p>

<span id="Pic"></span><h2 id="Picture">Picture (or Pic)</h2>
<p>Description: An area containing an image (see last two paragraphs for supported file types). The last parameter is the filename of the image, which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Picture", "w300 h-1", "C:\My Pictures\Company Logo.gif")</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddPicture("w300 h-1", "C:\My Pictures\Company Logo.gif")</pre>
<p>To retain the image's actual width and/or height, omit the W and/or H options. Otherwise, the image is scaled to the specified width and/or height (this width and height also determines which icon to load from a multi-icon .ICO file). To shrink or enlarge the image while preserving its aspect ratio, specify -1 for one of the dimensions and a positive number for the other. For example, specifying <code>w200 h-1</code> would make the image 200 pixels wide and cause its height to be set automatically. If the picture cannot be loaded or displayed (e.g. file not found), an error is thrown and the control is not added.</p>
<p>Picture controls support the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Click">Click</a> and <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#DoubleClick">DoubleClick</a> events, with the same <a href="#SS_NOTIFY">caveat</a> as Text controls.</p>
<p>To use a picture as a background for other controls, the picture should normally be added prior to those controls. However, if those controls are input-capable and the picture has the <a href="#SS_NOTIFY">SS_NOTIFY style</a> (which may be added automatically by <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm">OnEvent</a>), create the picture after the other controls and include <code>0x4000000</code> (which is WS_CLIPSIBLINGS) in the picture's <em>Options</em>. This trick also allows a picture to be the background behind a <a href="#Tab">Tab control</a> or <a href="ListView.htm">ListView</a>.</p>
<p id="IconSupport"><strong>Icons, cursors, and animated cursors</strong>: Icons and cursors may be loaded from the following types of files: ICO, CUR, ANI, EXE, DLL, CPL, SCR, and other types that contain icon resources. To use an icon group other than the first one in the file, include in <em>Options</em> the word Icon followed by the number of the group. In the following example, the default icon from the second icon group would be used: <code>MyGui.Add("Picture", "Icon2", "C:\My Application.exe")</code>.</p>
<p id="PicAltSubmit">Specifying the word AltSubmit in <em>Options</em> tells the program to use Microsoft's GDIPlus.dll to load the image, which might result in a different appearance for GIF, BMP, and icon images. For example, it would load a GIF that has a transparent background as a transparent bitmap, which allows the <a href="Gui.htm#BackgroundTrans">BackgroundTrans</a> option to take effect (but icons support transparency without AltSubmit).</p>
<p>Formats supported without the use of GDIPlus include GIF, JPG, BMP, ICO, CUR, and ANI images. GDIPlus is used by default for other image formats, such as PNG, TIF, Exif, WMF and EMF.</p>
<p><strong>Animated GIFs</strong>: Although animated GIF files can be displayed in a picture control, they will not actually be animated. To solve this, use the AniGIF DLL (which is free for non-commercial use) as demonstrated at the <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=6457">AutoHotkey Forums</a>. Alternatively, the <a href="#ActiveX">ActiveX</a> control type can be used. For example:</p>
<pre><em>; Specify below the path to the GIF file to animate (local files are allowed too):</em>
pic := "http://www.animatedgif.net/cartoons/A_5odie_e0.gif"
MyGui := Gui()
MyGui.Add("ActiveX", "w100 h150", "mshtml:&lt;img src='" pic "' /&gt;")
MyGui.Show</pre>
<p>A <a href="../misc/ImageHandles.htm">bitmap or icon handle</a> can be used instead of a filename. For example, <code>"HBITMAP:" handle</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Button">Button</h2>
<p>Description: A pushbutton, which can be pressed to trigger an action.  In this case, the last parameter is the name of the button (shown on the button itself), which may include linefeeds (`n) to start new lines.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyBtn := MyGui.Add("Button", "Default w80", "OK")
MyBtn.OnEvent("Click", MyBtn_Click)  <em>; Call MyBtn_Click when clicked.</em></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyBtn := MyGui.AddButton("Default w80", "OK")
MyBtn.OnEvent("Click", MyBtn_Click)  <em>; Call MyBtn_Click when clicked.</em>
</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_button.png" alt="Button" />
<p>The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Click">Click</a> event is raised whenever the user clicks the button or presses <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> while it has the focus.</p>
<p>The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#DoubleClick">DoubleClick</a>, <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Focus">Focus</a> and <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#LoseFocus">LoseFocus</a> events are also supported. As these events are only raised if the control has the BS_NOTIFY (0x4000) style, it is added automatically by <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm">OnEvent</a>.</p>
<p id="DefaultButton">The example above includes the word <strong>Default</strong> in its <em>Options</em> to make "OK" the default button. The default button's <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Click">Click event</a> is automatically triggered whenever the user presses <kbd>Enter</kbd>, except when the keyboard focus is on a different button or a multi-line edit control having the <a href="#WantReturn">WantReturn</a> style. To later change the default button to another button, follow this example, which makes the Cancel button become the default: <code>MyGui["Cancel"].<a href="GuiControl.htm#Opt">Opt</a>("+Default")</code>. To later change the window to have no default button, follow this example: <code>MyGui["OK"].Opt("-Default")</code>.</p>
<p>An ampersand (&amp;) may be used in the button name to underline one of its letters. For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Button",, "&amp;Pause")</pre>
<p>In the example above, the letter P will be underlined, which allows the user to press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> as <a href="Gui.htm#ShortcutKey">shortcut key</a>. To display a literal ampersand, specify two consecutive ampersands (&amp;&amp;).</p>

<p>Known limitation: Certain desktop themes might not display a button's text properly. If this occurs, try including <code>-Wrap</code> (minus Wrap) in the control's options. However, this also prevents having more than one line of text.</p>

<h2 id="Checkbox">Checkbox</h2>
<p>Description: A small box that can be checked or unchecked to represent On/Off, Yes/No, etc.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("CheckBox", "vShipToBillingAddress", "Ship to billing address?")</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddCheckBox("vShipToBillingAddress", "Ship to billing address?")</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_check.png" alt="Checkbox" />
<p>The last parameter is a label displayed next to the box, which is typically used as a prompt or description of what the checkbox does. It may include linefeeds (`n) to start new lines. If a width (W) is specified in <em>Options</em> but no <a href="Gui.htm#R">rows (R)</a> or height (H), the control's text will be word-wrapped as needed, and the control's height will be set automatically.</p>
<p><a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> returns the number 1 for checked, 0 for unchecked, and -1 for gray/indeterminate.</p>
<p>Specify the word <strong>Check3</strong> in <em>Options</em> to enable a third "indeterminate" state that displays a gray checkmark or a square instead of a black checkmark (the indeterminate state indicates that the checkbox is neither checked nor unchecked). Specify the word <strong>Checked</strong> or <strong>CheckedGray</strong> in <em>Options</em> to have the checkbox start off checked or indeterminate, respectively. The word Checked may optionally be followed immediately by a 0, 1, or -1 to indicate the starting state. In other words, <code>"Checked"</code> and <code>"Checked" VarContainingOne</code> are the same.</p>
<p>Whenever the checkbox is clicked, it automatically cycles between its two or three possible states, and then raises the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Click">Click</a> event, allowing the script to immediately respond to the user's input.</p>
<p>The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#DoubleClick">DoubleClick</a>, <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Focus">Focus</a> and <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#LoseFocus">LoseFocus</a> events are also supported. As these events are only raised if the control has the BS_NOTIFY (0x4000) style, it is added automatically by <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm">OnEvent</a>. This style is not applied by default as it prevents rapid clicks from changing the state of the checkmark (such as if the user clicks twice to toggle from unchecked to checked and then to indeterminate).</p>
<p>Known limitation: Certain desktop themes might not display a checkbox's text properly. If this occurs, try including <code>-Wrap</code> (minus Wrap) in the control's options. However, this also prevents having more than one line of text.</p>

<h2 id="Radio">Radio</h2>
<p>Description: A radio button is a small empty circle that can be checked (on) or unchecked (off).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Radio", "vMyRadioGroup", "Wait for all items to be in stock before shipping.")</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddRadio("vMyRadioGroup", "Wait for all items to be in stock before shipping.")</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_radio.png" alt="Radio" />
<p>These controls usually appear in <em>radio groups</em>, each of which contains two or more radio buttons. When the user clicks a radio button to turn it on, any others in its radio group are turned off automatically (the user may also navigate inside a group with the arrow keys). A radio group is created automatically around all consecutively added radio buttons. To start a new group, specify the word <strong>Group</strong> in the <em>Options</em> of the first button of the new group -- or simply add a non-radio control in between, since that automatically starts a new group.</p>
<p>For the last parameter, specify the label to display to the right of the radio button. This label is typically used as a prompt or description, and it may include linefeeds (`n) to start new lines. If a width (W) is specified in <em>Options</em> but no rows (R) or height (H), the control's text will be word-wrapped as needed, and the control's height will be set automatically.</p>
<p>Specify the word <strong>Checked</strong> in <em>Options</em> to have the button start off in the "on" state. The word Checked may optionally be followed immediately by a 0 or 1 to indicate the starting state: 0 for unchecked and 1 for checked. In other words, <code>"Checked"</code> and <code>"Checked" VarContainingOne</code> are the same.</p>
<p><a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> returns the number 1 for "on" and 0 for "off". To instead retrieve the position number of the selected radio option within a radio group, <a href="GuiControl.htm#Name">name</a> only one of the radio buttons and use <a href="Gui.htm#submit-radio">MyGui.Submit</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Click">Click</a> event is raised whenever the user turns on the button. Unlike the single-variable mode in the previous paragraph, the event callback must be registered for each button in a radio group for which it should be called. This allows the flexibility to ignore the clicks of certain buttons. </p>
<p>The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#DoubleClick">DoubleClick</a>, <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Focus">Focus</a> and <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#LoseFocus">LoseFocus</a> events are also supported. As these events are only raised if the control has the BS_NOTIFY (0x4000) style, it is added automatically by <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm">OnEvent</a>.</p>
<p>Known limitation: Certain desktop themes might not display a radio button's text properly. If this occurs, try including <code>-Wrap</code> (minus Wrap) in the control's options. However, this also prevents having more than one line of text.</p>

<span id="DDL"></span><h2 id="DropDownList">DropDownList (or DDL)</h2>
<p>Description: A list of choices that is displayed in response to pressing a small button.  In this case, the last parameter of <a href="Gui.htm#Add">MyGui.Add</a> is an <a href="Array.htm">Array</a> like <code>["Choice1","Choice2","Choice3"]</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("DropDownList", "vColorChoice", ["Black","White","Red"])</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddDropDownList("vColorChoice", ["Black","White","Red"])</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_ddl.png" alt="DDL" />
<p>To have one of the items pre-selected when the window first appears, include in <em>Options</em> the word <strong>Choose</strong> followed immediately by the number of an item to be pre-selected. For example, <code>Choose5</code> would pre-select the fifth item (as with other options, it can also be a variable such as <code>"Choose" Var</code>). After the control is created, use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a>, <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Choose">GuiCtrl.Choose</a> to change the selection, and <a href="GuiControl.htm#Add">GuiCtrl.Add</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Delete">GuiCtrl.Delete</a> to add or remove entries from the list.</p>
<p>Specify either the word <strong>Uppercase</strong> or <strong>Lowercase</strong> in <em>Options</em> to automatically convert all items in the list to uppercase or lowercase. Specify the word <strong>Sort</strong> to automatically sort the contents of the list alphabetically (this also affects any items  added later via <a href="GuiControl.htm#Add">GuiCtrl.Add</a>). The Sort option also enables incremental searching whenever the list is dropped down; this allows an item to be selected by typing the first few characters of its name.</p>
<p>When <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> is used, the return value is the position number of the currently selected item (the first item is 1, the second is 2, etc.) or zero if none is selected. To get its text instead, use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever the user selects a new item, the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> event is raised. The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Focus">Focus</a> and <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#LoseFocus">LoseFocus</a> events are also supported.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="Gui.htm#R">R or H option</a> to control the height of the popup list. For example, specifying <code>R5</code> would make the list 5 rows tall, while <code>H400</code> would set the total height of the selection field and list to 400 pixels. If both R and H are omitted, the list will automatically expand to take advantage of the available height of the user's desktop.</p>
<p id="ComboBoxHeight">To set the height of the selection field or list items, use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/controls/cb-setitemheight">CB_SETITEMHEIGHT</a> message as in the example below:</p>
<pre>MyGui := Gui()
DDL := MyGui.Add("DDL", "vcbx w200 Choose1", ["One","Two"])
<em>; CB_SETITEMHEIGHT = 0x0153</em>
PostMessage(0x0153, -1, 50, DDL)  <em>; Set height of selection field.</em>
PostMessage(0x0153, 0, 50, DDL)  <em>; Set height of list items.</em>
MyGui.Show("h70")</pre>

<h2 id="ComboBox">ComboBox</h2>
<p>Description: Same as DropDownList but also permits free-form text to be entered as an alternative to picking an item from the list.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("ComboBox", "vColorChoice", ["Red","Green","Blue"])</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddComboBox("vColorChoice", ["Red","Green","Blue"])</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_combo.png" alt="ComboBox" />
<p>In addition to allowing all the same options as DropDownList above, the word <strong>Limit</strong> may be included in <em>Options</em> to restrict the user's input to the visible width of the ComboBox's edit field. Also, the word <strong>Simple</strong> may be specified to make the ComboBox behave as though it is an Edit field with a ListBox beneath it.</p>
<p><a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> returns the position number of the currently selected item (the first item is 1, the second is 2, etc.) or 0 if the control contains text which does not match a list item. To get the contents of the ComboBox's edit field, use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a>. <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a> stores the text, unless the word <strong>AltSubmit</strong> is in the control's <em>Options</em> and the text matches a list item, in which case it stores the position number of the item.</p>
<p>Whenever the user selects a new item or changes the control's text, the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> event is raised. The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Focus">Focus</a> and <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#LoseFocus">LoseFocus</a> events are also supported.</p>

<h2 id="ListBox">ListBox</h2>
<p>Description: A relatively tall box containing a list of choices that can be selected. In this case, the last parameter of <a href="Gui.htm#Add">MyGui.Add</a> is an <a href="Array.htm">Array</a> like <code>["Choice1","Choice2","Choice3"]</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("ListBox", "r5 vColorChoice", ["Red","Green","Blue"])</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddListBox("r5 vColorChoice", ["Red","Green","Blue"])</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_list.png" alt="ListBox" />
<p id="ChooseLB">To have one of the items pre-selected when the window first appears, include in <em>Options</em> the word <strong>Choose</strong> followed immediately by the number of an item to be pre-selected. For example, <code>Choose5</code> would pre-select the fifth item. To have multiple items pre-selected, use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Choose">GuiCtrl.Choose</a> multiple times (requires the <a href="#ListBoxMulti">Multi</a> option). After the control is created, use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a>, <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Choose">GuiCtrl.Choose</a> to change the selection, and <a href="GuiControl.htm#Add">GuiCtrl.Add</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Delete">GuiCtrl.Delete</a> to add or remove entries from the list.</p>
<p>If the <a href="#ListBoxMulti">Multi</a> option is absent, <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> returns the position number of the currently selected item (the first item is 1, the second is 2, etc.) or 0 if there is no item selected. To get the selected item's text instead, use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a>. If the <a href="#ListBoxMulti">Multi</a> option is used, <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> and <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a> return an array of items instead of a single item.</p>
<p><a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a> stores <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a> by default, but stores <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> instead if the word <strong>AltSubmit</strong> is in the control's <em>Options</em>.</p>
<p>Whenever the user selects or deselects one or more items, the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> event is raised. The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#DoubleClick">DoubleClick</a>, <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Focus">Focus</a> and <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#LoseFocus">LoseFocus</a> events are also supported.</p>
<p id="LBRedraw">When adding a large number of items to a ListBox, performance may be improved by using <code>MyListBox.Opt("-Redraw")</code> prior to the operation, and <code>MyListBox.Opt("+Redraw")</code> afterward. See <a href="GuiControl.htm#redraw-remarks">Redraw</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="ListBox_Options">ListBox Options</h3>
<p><strong>Choose</strong>: See <a href="#ChooseLB">above</a>.</p>
<p id="ListBoxMulti"><strong>Multi</strong>: Allows more than one item to be selected simultaneously via shift-click and control-click (to avoid the need for shift/control-click, specify <a href="../misc/Styles.htm#LBS_MULTIPLESEL">the number 8</a> instead of the word Multi). In this case, <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> returns an array of selected position numbers. For example, <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> would indicate that the first three items are selected. To get an array of selected texts instead, use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a>. To extract the individual items from the array, use <code>MyListBox.Text[1]</code> (1 would be the first item) or a <a href="For.htm">For-loop</a> such as this example:</p>
<pre>For Index, Field in MyListBox.Text
{
    MsgBox "Selection number " Index " is " Field
}</pre>
<p><strong>ReadOnly</strong>: Prevents items from being visibly highlighted when they are selected (but <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a>, <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a> will still return the selected item).</p>
<p><strong>Sort</strong>: Automatically sorts the contents of the list alphabetically (this also affects any items added later via <a href="GuiControl.htm#Add">GuiCtrl.Add</a>). The Sort option also enables incremental searching, which allows an item to be selected by typing the first few characters of its name.</p>
<p><strong>Tn</strong>: The letter T may be used to set tab stops, which can be used to format the text into columns. If the letter T is not used, tab stops are set at every 32 dialog units (the width of each "dialog unit" is determined by the operating system). If the letter T is used only once, tab stops are set at every <strong>n</strong> units across the entire width of the control. For example, <code>MyGui.Add("ListBox", "vMyListBox t64")</code> would double the default distance between tab stops. To have custom tab stops, specify the letter T multiple times as in the following example: <code>MyGui.Add("ListBox", "vMyListBox t8 t16 t32 t64 t128")</code>. One tab stop is set for each of the absolute column positions in the list, up to a maximum of 50 tab stops.</p>
<p><strong>0x100</strong>: Include 0x100 in <em>Options</em> to turn on the LBS_NOINTEGRALHEIGHT style. This forces the ListBox to be exactly the height specified rather than a height that prevents a partial row from appearing at the bottom. This option also prevents the ListBox from shrinking when its font is changed.</p>
<p>To specify the number of rows of text (or the height and width), see <a href="Gui.htm#PosSize">position and sizing of controls</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ListView_and_TreeView">ListView and TreeView</h2>
<p>See separate pages <a href="ListView.htm">ListView</a> and <a href="TreeView.htm">TreeView</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Link">Link</h2>
<p>Description: A text control that can contain links similar to those found in a web browser. Within the control's text, enclose the link text within <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/A&gt;</code> to create a clickable link. Although this looks like HTML, Link controls only support the opening <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> tag (optionally with an ID and/or HREF attribute) and closing <code>&lt;/A&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Link",, 'This is a &lt;a href="https://www.autohotkey.com"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;')
MyGui.Add("Link",, 'Links may be used anywhere in the text like &lt;a id="A"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a id="B"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;')</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddLink(, 'This is a &lt;a href="https://www.autohotkey.com"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;')
MyGui.AddLink(, 'Links may be used anywhere in the text like &lt;a id="A"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a id="B"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;')</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_link.png" alt="Link" />

<p>Whenever the user clicks on a link, the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Click">Click</a> event is raised. If the control has no Click callback (registered by calling <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm">OnEvent</a>), the link's HREF is automatically executed as though passed to the <a href="Run.htm">Run</a> function.</p>
<pre>MyGui := Gui()
Link := MyGui.Add("Link",
    , 'Click to run &lt;a href="notepad" id="notepad"&gt;Notepad&lt;/a&gt; or open '
    . '&lt;a id="help" href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/"&gt;online help&lt;/a&gt;.')
Link.OnEvent("Click", Link_Click)
Link_Click(Ctrl, ID, HREF)
{
    if MsgBox("ID: " ID "`nHREF: " HREF "`n`nExecute this link?",, "y/n") = "yes"
        Run(HREF)
}
MyGui.Show()</pre>

<h2 id="Hotkey">Hotkey</h2>
<p>Description: A box that looks like a single-line edit control but instead accepts a keyboard combination pressed by the user. For example, if the user presses <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> on an English keyboard layout, the box would display "Ctrl + Alt + C".</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Hotkey", "vChosenHotkey")</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddHotkey("vChosenHotkey")</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_hotkey.png" alt="Hotkey" />
<p><a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> returns the control's hotkey modifiers and name, which are compatible with the <a href="Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> function. Examples: <code>^!C</code>, <code>+!Home</code>, <code>+^Down</code>, <code>^Numpad1</code>, <code>!NumpadEnd</code>. If there is no hotkey in the control, the value is blank.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Some keys are displayed the same even though they are retrieved as different names. For example, both <code>^Numpad7</code> and <code>^NumpadHome</code> might be displayed as Ctrl + Num 7.</p>
<p>By default, the control starts off with no hotkey specified. To instead have a default, specify its modifiers and name as the last parameter as in this example: <code>MyGui.Add("Hotkey", "vChosenHotkey", "^!p")</code>. The only modifiers supported are ^ (Ctrl), ! (Alt), and + (Shift). See the <a href="../KeyList.htm">key list</a> for available key names.</p>
<p>Whenever the user changes the control's content (by pressing a key), the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> event is raised.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The event is raised even when an incomplete hotkey is present. For example, if the user holds down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, the event is raised once and <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">Value</a> returns only a circumflex (^). When the user completes the hotkey, the event is raised again and <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">Value</a> returns the complete hotkey.</p>
<p>To restrict the types of hotkeys the user may enter, include the word <strong>Limit</strong> followed by the sum of one or more of the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1: Prevent unmodified keys</li>
  <li>2: Prevent <kbd>Shift</kbd>-only keys</li>
  <li>4: Prevent <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-only keys</li>
  <li>8: Prevent <kbd>Alt</kbd>-only keys</li>
  <li>16: Prevent <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> keys</li>
  <li>32: Prevent <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd> keys</li>
  <li>64: This value is not supported (it will not behave correctly)</li>
  <li>128: Prevent <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd> keys</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, <code>Limit1</code> would prevent unmodified hotkeys such as letters and numbers from being entered, and <code>Limit15</code> would require at least two modifier keys. If the user types a forbidden modifier combination, the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd> combination is automatically and visibly substituted.</p>
<p>The Hotkey control has limited capabilities. For example, it does not support mouse/joystick hotkeys or <kbd>Win</kbd> (LWin and RWin). One way to work around this is to provide one or more <a href="#Checkbox">checkboxes</a> as a means for the user to enable extra modifiers such as <kbd>Win</kbd>.</p>

<h2 id="DateTime">DateTime</h2>
<p>Description: A box that looks like a single-line edit control but instead accepts a date and/or time. A drop-down calendar is also provided.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("DateTime", "vMyDateTime", "LongDate")</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddDateTime("vMyDateTime", "LongDate")</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_datetime.png" alt="DateTime" />
<p>The last parameter is a format string, as described below.</p>
<div class="methodShort" id="DateTimeFormat">
<h3>SetFormat</h3>
<p>Sets the display format of a DateTime control.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">DateTime.<span class="func">SetFormat</span>(<span class="optional">Format</span>)</pre>
<dl><dt>Format</dt><dd>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>One of the following:</p>
<p><strong>ShortDate</strong> (or omitted/blank): Uses the locale's short date format. For example, in some locales it would look like: 6/1/2005</p>
<p><strong>LongDate</strong>: Uses the locale's long date format. For example, in some locales it would look like: Wednesday, June 01, 2005</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong>: Shows only the time using the locale's time format. Although the date is not shown, it is still present in the control and will be retrieved along with the time in the <a href="FileSetTime.htm#YYYYMMDD">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a> format. For example, in some locales it would look like: 9:37:45 PM</p>
<p><strong>(custom format)</strong>: Specify any combination of <a href="FormatTime.htm">date and time formats</a>. For example, <code>"M/d/yy HH:mm"</code> would look like 6/1/05 21:37. Similarly, <code>"dddd MMMM d, yyyy hh:mm:ss tt"</code> would look like Wednesday June 1, 2005 09:37:45 PM. Letters and numbers to be displayed literally should be enclosed in single quotes as in this example: <code>"'Date:' MM/dd/yy 'Time:' hh:mm:ss tt"</code>. By contrast, non-alphanumeric characters such as spaces, tabs, slashes, colons, commas, and other punctuation do not need to be enclosed in single quotes. The exception to this is the single quote character itself: to produce it literally, use four consecutive single quotes (''''), or just two if the quote is already inside an outer pair of quotes.</p>
</dd></dl>
</div>

<h3 id="DateTime_Usage">DateTime Usage</h3>
<p id="ChooseDT">To have a date other than today pre-selected, include in <em>Options</em> the word <strong>Choose</strong> followed immediately by a date in YYYYMMDD format. For example, <code>Choose20050531</code> would pre-select May 31, 2005 (as with other options, it can also be a variable such as <code>"Choose" Var</code>). To have no date/time selected, specify <strong>ChooseNone</strong>. <em>ChooseNone</em> also creates a checkbox inside the control that is unchecked whenever the control has no date. Whenever the control has no date, <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> will retrieve a blank value (empty string).</p>
<p>The time of day may optionally be present. However, it must always be preceded by a date when going into or coming out of the control. The format of the time portion is HH24MISS (hours, minutes, seconds), where HH24 is expressed in 24-hour format; for example, 09 is 9am and 21 is 9pm. Thus, a complete date-time string would have the format <a href="FileSetTime.htm#YYYYMMDD">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a>.</p>
<p>When specifying dates in the YYYYMMDDHH24MISS format, only the leading part needs to be present. Any remaining element that has been omitted will be supplied with the following default values: MM with month 01, DD with day 01, HH24 with hour 00, MI with minute 00 and SS with second 00.</p>
<p>Within the drop-down calendar, the today-string at the bottom can be clicked to select today's date. In addition, the year and month name are clickable and allow easy navigation to a new month or year.</p>
<p id="DateTime_Keyboard_Navigation">Keyboard navigation: Use the <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>/<kbd>&darr;</kbd> arrow keys, the <kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd> numpad keys, and <kbd>Home</kbd>/<kbd>End</kbd> to increase or decrease the control's values. Use <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> to move from field to field inside the control. Within the drop-down calendar, use the arrow keys to move from day to day; use <kbd>PgUp</kbd>/<kbd>PgDn</kbd> to move backward/forward by one month; and use <kbd>Home</kbd>/<kbd>End</kbd> to select the first/last day of the month.</p>
<p>When <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> is used, the return value is the selected date and time in <a href="FileSetTime.htm#YYYYMMDD">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a> format. Both the date and the time are present regardless of whether they were actually visible in the control.</p>
<p>Whenever the user changes the date or time, the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> event is raised. The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Focus">Focus</a> and <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#LoseFocus">LoseFocus</a> events are also supported.</p>

<h3 id="DateTime_Options">DateTime Options</h3>
<p><strong>Choose</strong>: See <a href="#ChooseDT">above</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>: Restricts how far back or forward in time the selected date can be. After the word Range, specify the minimum and maximum dates in YYYYMMDD format (with a dash between them). For example, <code>Range20050101-20050615</code> would restrict the date to the first 5.5 months of 2005. Either the minimum or maximum may be omitted to leave the control unrestricted in that direction. For example, <code>Range20010101</code> would prevent a date prior to 2001 from being selected and <code>Range-20091231</code> (leading dash) would prevent a date later than 2009 from being selected. Without the Range option, any date between the years 1601 and 9999 can be selected. The time of day cannot be restricted.</p>
<p><strong>Right</strong>: Causes the drop-down calendar to drop down on the right side of the control instead of the left.</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>: Specify the number 1 in <em>Options</em> to provide an up-down control to the right of the control to modify date-time values, which replaces the button of the drop-down month calendar that would otherwise be available. This does not work in conjunction with the format option LongDate described above.</p>
<p id="ChooseNone"><strong>2</strong>: Specify the number 2 in <em>Options</em> to provide a checkbox inside the control that the user may uncheck to indicate that no date/time is selected. Once the control is created, this option cannot be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Colors inside the drop-down calendar</strong>: The colors of the day numbers inside the drop-down calendar obey that set by <a href="Gui.htm#SetFont">Gui.SetFont</a> or the <a href="Gui.htm#OtherOptions">c (Color)</a> option. To change the colors of other parts of the calendar, follow this example:</p>
<pre><a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> 0x1006, 4, 0xFFAA99, "SysDateTimePick321" <em>; 0x1006 is DTM_SETMCCOLOR. 4 is MCSC_MONTHBK (background color). The color must be specified in BGR vs. RGB format (red and blue components swapped).</em></pre>

<h2 id="MonthCal">MonthCal</h2>
<p>Description: A tall and wide control that displays all the days of the month in calendar format. The user may select a single date or a range of dates.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("MonthCal", "vMyCalendar")</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddMonthCal("vMyCalendar")</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_monthcal.png" alt="MonthCal" />
<p>To have a date other than today pre-selected, specify it as the third parameter in YYYYMMDD format (e.g. <code>20050531</code>). A range of dates may also be pre-selected by including a dash between two dates (e.g. <code>"20050525-20050531"</code>).</p>
<p>It is usually best to omit width (W) and height (H) for a MonthCal because it automatically sizes itself to fit exactly one month. To display more than one month vertically, specify <code>R2</code> or higher in <em>Options</em>. To display more than one month horizontally, specify <code>W-2</code> (W negative two) or higher. These options may both be present to expand in both directions.</p>
<p>The today-string at the bottom of the control can be clicked to select today's date. In addition, the year and month name are clickable and allow easy selection of a new year or month.</p>
<p>Keyboard navigation: Keyboard navigation is fully supported in MonthCal, but only if it has the keyboard focus. For supported keyboard shortcuts, see <a href="#DateTime_Keyboard_Navigation">DateTime's keyboard navigation</a> (within the drop-down calendar).</p>
<p>When <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> is used, the return value is the selected date in YYYYMMDD format (without any time portion). However, when the <a href="#MonthCalMulti">multi-select</a> option is in effect, the minimum and maximum dates are retrieved with a dash between them (e.g. <code>20050101-20050108</code>). If only a single date was selected in a multi-select calendar, the minimum and maximum are both present but identical. <a href="StrSplit.htm">StrSplit</a> can be used to separate the dates. For example, the following would put the minimum in Date[1] and the maximum in Date[2]: <code>Date := StrSplit(MyMonthCal.Value, "-")</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> event is raised when the user changes the selection.</p>
<p>When specifying dates in the YYYYMMDD format, the MM and/or DD portions may be omitted, in which case they are assumed to be 1. For example, <code>200205</code> is seen as 20020501, and <code>2005</code> is seen as 20050101.</p>

<h3 id="MonthCal_Options">MonthCal Options</h3>
<p id="MonthCalMulti"><strong>Multi</strong>: Multi-select. Allows the user to shift-click or click-drag to select a range of adjacent dates (the user may still select a single date too). This option may be specified explicitly or put into effect automatically by means of specifying a selection range when the control is created. For example: <code>MyGui.Add("MonthCal", "vMyCal", "20050101-20050108")</code>. Once the control is created, this option cannot be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>: Restricts how far back or forward in time the calendar can go. After the word Range, specify the minimum and maximum dates in YYYYMMDD format (with a dash between them). For example, <code>Range20050101-20050615</code> would restrict the selection to the first 5.5 months of 2005. Either the minimum or maximum may be omitted to leave the calendar unrestricted in that direction. For example, <code>Range20010101</code> would prevent a date prior to 2001 from being selected and <code>Range-20091231</code> (leading dash) would prevent a date later than 2009 from being selected. Without the Range option, any date between the years 1601 and 9999 can be selected.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong>: Specify the number 4 in <em>Options</em> to display week numbers (1-52) to the left of each row of days. Week 1 is defined as the first week that contains at least four days.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong>: Specify the number 8 in <em>Options</em> to prevent the circling of today's date within the control.</p>
<p><strong>16</strong>: Specify the number 16 in <em>Options</em> to prevent the display of today's date at the bottom of the control.</p>
<p><strong>Colors</strong>: The colors of the day numbers inside the calendar obey that set by <a href="Gui.htm#SetFont">Gui.SetFont</a> or the <a href="Gui.htm#OtherOptions">c (Color)</a> option. To change the colors of other parts of the calendar, follow this example:</p>
<pre><a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> 0x100A, 5, 0xFFAA99, "SysMonthCal321" <em>; 0x100A is MCM_SETCOLOR. 5 is MCSC_TITLETEXT (color of title text). The color must be specified in BGR vs. RGB format (red and blue components swapped).</em></pre>

<h2 id="Slider">Slider</h2>
<p>Description: A sliding bar that the user can move along a vertical or horizontal track. The standard volume control in the taskbar's tray is an example of a slider.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Slider", "vMySlider", 50)</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddSlider("vMySlider", 50)</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>

<p>Specify the starting position of the slider as the last parameter. If the last parameter  is omitted, the slider starts off at 0 or the number in the allowable range that is closest to 0.</p>
<p>The user may slide the control by the following means: 1) dragging the bar with the mouse; 2) clicking inside the bar's track area with the mouse; 3) turning the mouse wheel while the control has focus; or 4) pressing the following keys while the control has focus: <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>, <kbd>&rarr;</kbd>, <kbd>&darr;</kbd>, <kbd>&larr;</kbd>, <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>PgDn</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>, and <kbd>End</kbd>.</p>

<h3 id="slider-change">Detecting Changes</h3>
<p>By default, the slider's <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> event is raised when the user has stopped moving the slider, such as by releasing the mouse button after having dragging it.

<h3 id="Slider_Options">Slider Options</h3>
<p><strong>Buddy1</strong> and <strong>Buddy2</strong>: Specifies up to two existing controls to automatically reposition at the ends of the slider. Buddy1 is displayed at the left or top side (depending on whether the Vertical option is present). Buddy2 is displayed at the right or bottom side. After the word Buddy1 or Buddy2, specify the <a href="GuiControl.htm#Name">Name</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Hwnd">HWND</a> of an existing control. For example, <code>Buddy1MyTopText</code> would assign the control whose name is MyTopText. The text or ClassNN of a control can also be used, but only up to the first space or tab.</p>
<p><strong>Center</strong>: The thumb (the bar moved by the user) will be blunt on both ends rather than pointed at one end.</p>
<p><strong>Invert</strong>: Reverses the control so that the lower value is considered to be on the right/bottom rather than the left/top. This is typically used to make a vertical slider move in the direction of a traditional volume control. Note: The ToolTip option described below will not obey the inversion and therefore should not be used in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Left</strong>: The thumb (the bar moved by the user) will point to the top rather than the bottom. But if the Vertical option is in effect, the thumb will point to the left rather than the right.</p>
<p><strong>Line</strong>: Specifies the number of positions to move when the user presses one of the arrow keys. After the word Line, specify number of positions to move. For example: <code>Line2</code>.</p>
<p><strong>NoTicks</strong>: Omits tickmarks alongside the track.</p>
<p><strong>Page</strong>: Specifies the number of positions to move when the user presses <kbd>PgUp</kbd> or <kbd>PgDn</kbd>. After the word Page, specify number of positions to move. For example: <code>Page10</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>: Sets the range to be something other than 0 to 100. After the word Range, specify the minimum, a dash, and maximum. For example, <code>Range1-1000</code> would allow a number between 1 and 1000 to be selected; <code>Range-50-50</code> would allow a number between -50 and 50; and <code>Range-10--5</code> would allow a number between -10 and -5.</p>
<p><strong>Thick</strong>: Specifies the length of the thumb (the bar moved by the user). After the word Thick, specify the thickness in pixels (e.g. <code>Thick30</code>). To go beyond a certain thickness, it is probably necessary to either specify the Center option or remove the theme from the control (which can be done by specifying <code>-Theme</code> in the control's options).</p>
<p><strong>TickInterval</strong>: Provides tickmarks alongside the track at the specified interval. After the word TickInterval, specify the interval at which to display additional tickmarks (if the interval is never set, it defaults to 1). For example, <code>TickInterval10</code> would display a tickmark once every 10 positions.</p>
<p><strong>ToolTip</strong>: Creates a tooltip that reports the numeric position of the slider as the user is dragging it. To have the tooltip appear in a non-default position, specify one of the following instead: <code>ToolTipLeft</code> or <code>ToolTipRight</code> (for vertical sliders); <code>ToolTipTop</code> or <code>ToolTipBottom</code> (for horizontal sliders).</p>
<p><strong>Vertical</strong>: Makes the control slide up and down rather than left and right.</p>
<p>The above options can be changed via <a href="GuiControl.htm#Opt">GuiCtrl.Opt</a> after the control is created.</p>

<h2 id="Progress">Progress</h2>
<p>Description: A dual-color bar typically used to indicate how much progress has been made toward the completion of an operation.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Progress", "w200 h20 cBlue vMyProgress", 75)</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddProgress("w200 h20 cBlue vMyProgress", 75)</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_progress.png" alt="Progress" />
<p>Specify the starting position of the bar as the third parameter (if omitted, the bar starts off at 0 or the number in the allowable range that is closest to 0). To later change the position of the bar, follow these examples, all of which operate upon a progress bar whose <a href="GuiControl.htm#Name">Name</a> is MyProgress:</p>
<pre>MyGui["MyProgress"].<a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">Value</a> += 20  <em>; Increase the current position by 20.</em>
MyGui["MyProgress"].Value := 50  <em>; Set the current position to 50.</em></pre>
<p>For horizontal Progress Bars, the thickness of the bar is equal to the control's height. For vertical Progress Bars it is equal to the control's width.</p>

<h3 id="Progress_Options">Progress Options</h3>
<p><strong>Cn</strong>: Changes the bar's color. Specify for <strong>n</strong> one of the 16 primary HTML <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">color names</a> or a 6-digit RGB color value. Examples: <code>cRed</code>, <code>cFFFF33</code>, <code>cDefault</code>. If the C option is never used (or <code>cDefault</code> is specified), the system's default bar color will be used.</p>
<p><strong>BackgroundN</strong>: Changes the bar's background color. Specify for <strong>n</strong> one of the 16 primary HTML <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">color names</a> or a 6-digit RGB color value. Examples: <code>BackgroundGreen</code>, <code>BackgroundFFFF33</code>, <code>BackgroundDefault</code>. If the Background option is never used (or <code>BackgroundDefault</code> is specified), the background color will be that of the window or <a href="#Tab">tab control</a> behind it.</p>
<p><strong>Range</strong>: Sets the range to be something other than 0 to 100. After the word Range, specify the minimum, a dash, and maximum. For example, <code>Range0-1000</code> would allow numbers between 0 and 1000; <code>Range-50-50</code> would allow numbers between -50 and 50; and <code>Range-10--5</code> would allow numbers between -10 and -5.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth</strong>: Displays a simple continuous bar. If this option is not used and the bar does not have any custom colors, the bar's appearance is defined by the current system theme. Otherwise, the bar appears as a length of segments.</p>
<p><strong>Vertical</strong>: Makes the bar rise or fall vertically rather than move along horizontally.</p>
<p>The above options can be changed via <a href="GuiControl.htm#Opt">GuiCtrl.Opt</a> after the control is created.</p>

<h2 id="GroupBox">GroupBox</h2>
<p>Description: A rectangular border/frame, often used around other controls to indicate they are related. In this case, the last parameter is the title of the box, which if present is displayed at its upper-left edge.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("GroupBox", "w200 h100", "Geographic Criteria")</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddGroupBox("w200 h100", "Geographic Criteria")</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_group.png" alt="GroupBox" />
<p>By default, a GroupBox's title may have only one line of text. This can be overridden by specifying <code>Wrap</code> in <em>Options</em>.</p>
<p>To specify the number of rows inside the control (or its height and width), see <a href="Gui.htm#PosSize">position and sizing of controls</a>.</p>

<span id="Tab2"></span><h2 id="Tab">Tab3</h2>
<p>Description: A large control containing multiple pages, each of which contains other controls. From this point forward, these pages are referred to as "tabs".</p>
<p>There are three types of Tab control:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tab3</strong>: Fixes some issues which affect Tab2 and Tab. Controls are placed within an invisible "tab dialog" which moves and resizes with the tab control. The tab control is themed by default.</li>
  <li><strong>Tab2</strong>: Fixes rare redrawing problems in the original "Tab" control but introduces <a href="#Tab2_Issues">some other problems</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Tab</strong>: Retained for backward compatibility because of <a href="#Tab_vs">differences in behavior</a> between Tab2/Tab3 and Tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Tab3",, ["General","View","Settings"])</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>MyGui.AddTab3(, ["General","View","Settings"])</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_tab.png" alt="Tab" />
<p id="ChooseTab">The last parameter above is an <a href="Array.htm">Array</a> of tab names. To have one of the tabs pre-selected when the window first appears, include in <em>Options</em> the word <strong>Choose</strong> followed immediately by the number of a tab to be pre-selected. For example, <code>Choose5</code> would pre-select the fifth tab (as with other options, it can also be a variable such as <code>"Choose" Var</code>). After the control is created, use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">Value</a>, <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">Text</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Choose">Choose</a> to change the selected tab, and <a href="GuiControl.htm#Add">Add</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm#Delete">Delete</a> to add or remove tabs.</p>
<p id="TabCmd">After creating a Tab control, subsequently added controls automatically belong to its first tab. This can be changed at any time by following these examples (in this case, <em>Tab</em> is the <a href="GuiControl.htm">GuiControl object</a> of the first tab control and <em>Tab2</em> of the second one):</p>
<pre>Tab.<a href="GuiControl.htm#UseTab">UseTab</a>()  <em>; Future controls are not part of any tab control.</em>
Tab.UseTab(3)  <em>; Future controls are owned by the third tab of the current tab control.</em>
Tab2.UseTab(3)  <em>; Future controls are owned by the third tab of the second tab control.</em>
Tab.UseTab("Name")  <em>; Future controls are owned by the tab whose name starts with <i>Name</i> (not case sensitive).</em>
Tab.UseTab("Name", true)  <em>; Same as above but requires exact match (not case sensitive).</em></pre>
<p>It is also possible to use any of the examples above to assign controls to a tab or tab-control that does not yet exist (except in the case of the <em>Name</em> method). But in that case, the relative positioning options described below are not supported.</p>
<p id="Tab_Positioning1"><strong>Positioning</strong>: When each tab of a Tab control receives its first sub-control, that sub-control will have a special default position under the following conditions: 1) The X and Y coordinates are both omitted, in which case the first sub-control is positioned at the upper-left corner of the tab control's interior (with a standard <a href="Gui.htm#MarginX">margin</a>), and sub-controls beyond the first are positioned beneath the previous control; 2) The <a href="Gui.htm#PosPlus">X+n and/or Y+n</a> positioning options are specified, in which case the sub-control is positioned relative to the upper-left corner of the tab control's interior. For example, specifying <code>x+10 y+10</code> would position the control 10 pixels right and 10 pixels down from the upper left corner.</p>
<p><strong>Current tab</strong>: <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> returns the position number of the currently selected tab (the first tab is 1, the second is 2, etc.). To get its text instead, use <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a>. <a href="Gui.htm#Submit">MyGui.Submit</a> stores <a href="GuiControl.htm#Text">GuiCtrl.Text</a> by default, but stores <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> instead if the word <strong>AltSubmit</strong> is in the control's <em>Options</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Detecting tab selection</strong>: Whenever the user switches tabs, the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Change">Change</a> event is raised.</p>
<p id="Tab_Keyboard"><strong>Keyboard navigation</strong>: The user may press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PgDn</kbd>/<kbd>PgUp</kbd> to navigate from page to page in a tab control; if the keyboard focus is on a control that does not belong to a Tab control, the window's first Tab control will be navigated. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> may also be used except that they will not work if the currently focused control is a multi-line Edit control.</p>
<p id="Tab_Limits"><strong>Limits</strong>: Each window may have no more than 255 tab controls. Each tab control may have no more than 256 tabs (pages). In addition, a tab control may not contain other tab controls.</p>

<h3 id="Tab_vs">Tab3 vs. Tab2 vs. Tab</h3>
<p id="Tab_Parent"><strong>Parent window</strong>: The parent window of a control affects the positioning and visibility of the control and tab-key navigation order. If a sub-control is added to an existing Tab3 control, its parent window is the "tab dialog", which fills the tab control's display area. Most other controls, including sub-controls of Tab or Tab2 controls, have no parent other than the GUI window itself.</p>
<p id="Tab_Positioning"><strong>Positioning</strong>: For Tab and Tab2, sub-controls do not necessarily need to exist within their tab control's boundaries: they will still be hidden and shown whenever their tab is selected or de-selected. This behavior is especially appropriate for the "buttons" style described below.</p>
<p>For Tab3, sub-controls assigned to a tab <em>before</em> the tab control is created behave as though added to a Tab or Tab2 control. All other sub-controls are visible only within the display area of the tab control.</p>
<p>If a Tab3 control is moved, its sub-controls are moved with it. Tab and Tab2 controls do not have this behavior.</p>
<p>In the rare case that <a href="WinMove.htm">WinMove</a> (or an equivalent DllCall) is used to move a control, the coordinates must be relative to the parent window of the control, which might not be the GUI (see <a href="#Tab_Parent">above</a>). By contrast, <a href="GuiControl.htm#Move">GuiCtrl.Move</a> takes GUI coordinates and <a href="ControlMove.htm">ControlMove</a> takes window coordinates, regardless of the control's parent window.</p>
<p id="Tab_Autosize"><strong>Autosizing</strong>: If not specified by the script, the width and/or height of the Tab3 control are automatically calculated at one of the following times (whichever comes first after the control is created):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first time the Tab3 control ceases to be the current tab control. This can occur as a result of calling <a href="#TabCmd">GuiCtrl.UseTab</a> (with or without parameters) or creating another tab control.</li>
  <li>The first time <a href="Gui.htm#Show">MyGui.Show</a> is called for that particular Gui.</li>
</ul>
<p>The calculated size accounts for sub-controls which exist when autosizing occurs, plus the default margins. The size is calculated only once, and will not be recalculated even if controls are added later. If the Tab3 control is empty, it receives the same default size as a Tab or Tab2 control.</p>
<p>Tab and Tab2 controls are not autosized; they receive an arbitrary default size.</p>
<p id="Tab_TabOrder"><strong>Tab-key navigation order</strong>: The navigation order via <kbd>Tab</kbd> usually depends on the order in which the controls are created. When tab controls are used, the order also depends on the type of tab control:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tab and Tab2 allow their sub-controls to be mixed with other controls within the tab-key order.</li>
  <li>Tab2 puts its tab buttons after its sub-controls in the tab-key order.</li>
  <li>Tab3 groups its sub-controls within the tab-key order and puts them after its tab buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Tab_Notifs"><strong>Notification messages (Tab3)</strong>: Common and <a href="#Custom">Custom</a> controls typically send notification messages to their <a href="#Tab_Parent">parent window</a>. Any WM_COMMAND, WM_NOTIFY, WM_VSCROLL, WM_HSCROLL or WM_CTLCOLOR' messages received by a Tab3 control's <a href="#Tab_Parent">tab dialog</a> are forwarded to the GUI window and can be detected by using <a href="OnMessage.htm">OnMessage</a>. If the tab control is themed and the sub-control lacks the <a href="Gui.htm#BackgroundTrans">+BackgroundTrans</a> option, WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC is fully handled by the tab dialog and not forwarded. Other notification messages (such as custom messages) are not supported.</p>
<p id="Tab2_Issues"><strong>Known issues with Tab2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Gui.htm#BackgroundTrans">BackgroundTrans</a> has no effect inside a Tab2 control.</li>
  <li><a href="#ActiveX">WebBrowser</a> controls do not redraw correctly.</li>
  <li>AnimateWindow and possibly other Win32 API calls can cause the tab's controls to disappear.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Tab_Issues"><strong>Known issues with Tab</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Activating a GUI window by clicking certain parts of its controls, such as scrollbars, might redraw improperly.</li>
  <li><a href="Gui.htm#BackgroundTrans">BackgroundTrans</a> has no effect if the Tab control contains a ListView.</li>
  <li><a href="#ActiveX">WebBrowser</a> controls are invisible.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Tab_Options">Tab Options</h3>
<p><strong>Choose</strong>: See <a href="#ChooseTab">above</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: Specify <code>-Background</code> (minus Background) to override the <a href="Gui.htm#BackColor">window's custom background color</a> and use the system's default Tab control color. Specify <code>+Theme -Background</code> to make the Tab control conform to the current desktop theme. However, most control types will look strange inside such a Tab control because their backgrounds will not match that of the tab control. This can be fixed for some control types (such as <a href="#Text">Text</a>) by adding BackgroundTrans to their options.</p>
<p><strong>Buttons</strong>: Creates a series of buttons at the top of the control rather than a series of tabs (in this case, there will be no border by default because the display area does not typically contain controls).</p>
<p><strong>Left/Right/Bottom</strong>: Specify one of these words to have the tabs on the left, right, or bottom side instead of the top. See <a href="../misc/Styles.htm#TCS_VERTICAL">TCS_VERTICAL</a> for limitations on Left and Right.</p>
<p><strong>Wrap</strong>: Specify <code>-Wrap</code> (minus Wrap) to prevent the tabs from taking up more than a single row (in which case if there are too many tabs to fit, arrow buttons are displayed to allow the user to slide more tabs into view).</p>
<p>To specify the number of rows of text inside the control (or its height and width), see <a href="Gui.htm#PosSize">position and sizing of controls</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Icons in Tabs</strong>: An icon may be displayed next to each tab's name/text via <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>. This is demonstrated in the forum topic <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic6060.html">Icons in tabs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="StatusBar">StatusBar</h2>
<p>Description: A row of text and/or icons attached to the bottom of a window, which is typically used to report changing conditions.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>SB := MyGui.Add("StatusBar",, "Bar's starting text (omit to start off empty).")
SB.SetText("There are " . RowCount . " rows selected.")</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre>SB := MyGui.AddStatusBar(, "Bar's starting text (omit to start off empty).")
SB.SetText("There are " . RowCount . " rows selected.")</pre>
<p>Appearance:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_status.png" alt="StatusBar" />
<p>The simplest use of a status bar is to call <a href="#SB_SetText">SB.SetText</a> whenever something changes that should be reported to the user. To report more than one piece of information, divide the bar into sections via <a href="#SB_SetParts">SB.SetParts</a>. To display icon(s) in the bar, call <a href="#SB_SetIcon">SB.SetIcon</a>.</p>

<h3 id="StatusBar_Methods">StatusBar Methods</h3>

<div class="methodShort" id="SB_SetText">
<h3>SetText</h3>
<p>Displays <em>NewText</em> in the specified part of the status bar.</p>

<dl><dt>NewText</dt><dd>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>Up to two tab characters (`t) may be present anywhere in <em>NewText</em>: anything to the right of the first tab is centered within the part, and anything to the right of the second tab is right-justified.</p></dd><dt>PartNumber</dt><dd>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>If <em>PartNumber</em> is omitted, it defaults to 1. Otherwise, specify an integer between 1 and 256.</p></dd><dt>Style</dt><dd>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>If <em>Style</em> is omitted, it defaults to 0, which uses a traditional border that makes that part of the bar look sunken. Otherwise, specify 1 to have no border or 2 to have border that makes that part of the bar look raised.</p></dd></dl>
</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="SB_SetParts">
<h3>SetParts</h3>
<p>Divides the bar into multiple sections according to the specified widths (in pixels), and returns a non-zero value (the status bar's <a href="GuiControl.htm#Hwnd">HWND</a>).</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Hwnd := SB.<span class="func">SetParts</span>(<span class="optional">Width1, Width2, ... Width255</span>)</pre>
<dl><dt>Width1 ... Width255</dt><dd>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>If all parameters are omitted, the bar is restored to having only a single, long part. Otherwise, specify the width of each part except the last (the last will fill the remaining width of the bar). For example, <code>SB.SetParts(50, 50)</code> would create three parts: the first two of width 50 and the last one of all the remaining width.</p></dd></dl>
<p>Note: Any parts "deleted" by <code>SB.SetParts()</code> will start off with no text the next time they are shown (furthermore, their icons are automatically destroyed).</p></div>

<div class="methodShort" id="SB_SetIcon">
<h3>SetIcon</h3>
<p>Displays a small icon to the left of the text in the specified part, and returns the icon's handle.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">HICON := SB.<span class="func">SetIcon</span>(Filename <span class="optional">, IconNumber, PartNumber</span>)</pre>
<dl><dt>FileName</dt><dd>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>The path of an icon or image file. For a list of supported formats, see <a href="#IconSupport">the Picture control</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="../misc/ImageHandles.htm">bitmap or icon handle</a> can be used instead of a filename. For example, <code>SB.SetIcon("HICON:" handle)</code>.</p></dd>
<dt>IconNumber</dt><dd>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>To use an icon group other than the first one in the file, specify its number for <em>IconNumber</em>. For example, <code>SB.SetIcon("Shell32.dll", 2)</code> would use the default icon from the second icon group. If <em>IconNumber</em> is negative, its absolute value is assumed to be the resource ID of an icon within an executable file.</p></dd><dt>PartNumber</dt><dd>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>If <em>PartNumber</em> is omitted, it defaults to 1. Otherwise, specify an integer between 1 and 256.</p></dd></dl>
<p>Note: The HICON is a system resource that can be safely ignored by most scripts because it is destroyed automatically when the status bar's window is destroyed. Similarly, any old icon is destroyed when <code>SB.SetIcon()</code> replaces it with a new one. This can be avoided via:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Opt("+LastFound")
<a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>(0x040F, part_number - 1, my_hIcon, "msctls_statusbar321")  <em>; 0x040F is SB_SETICON.</em></pre></div>

<div class="methodShort" id="SB_SetProgress">
<h3>SetProgress</h3>
<p>Creates and controls a progress bar inside the status bar. This function is available at <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic37754.html">www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic37754.html</a></p></div>

<h3 id="StatusBar_Usage">StatusBar Usage</h3>
<p><strong>Reacting to mouse clicks</strong>: Whenever the user clicks on the bar, the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Click">Click</a>, <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#DoubleClick">DoubleClick</a> or <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#ContextMenu">ContextMenu</a> event is raised, and the <em>Info</em> or <em>Item</em> parameter contains the part number. However, the part number might be a very large integer if the user clicks near the sizing grip at the right side of the bar.</p>
<p><strong>Font and color</strong>: Although the font size, face, and style can be set via <a href="Gui.htm#SetFont">MyGui.SetFont</a> (just like normal controls), the text color cannot be changed. The status bar's background color may be changed by specifying in <em>Options</em> the word <strong>Background</strong> followed immediately by a color name (see <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">color chart</a>) or RGB value (the 0x prefix is optional). Examples: <code>BackgroundSilver</code>, <code>BackgroundFFDD99</code>, <code>BackgroundDefault</code>. Note that the control must have Classic Theme appearance. Thus, the <code>-Theme</code> option must be specified along with the Background option, e.g. <code>-Theme BackgroundSilver</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Hiding the StatusBar</strong>: Upon creation, the bar can be hidden via <code>MyStatusBar := MyGui.Add("StatusBar", "Hidden")</code>. To hide it sometime after creation, use <code>MyStatusBar.Visible := false</code>. To show it, use <code>MyStatusBar.Visible := true</code>. Note: Hiding the bar does not reduce the height of the window. If that is desired, one easy way is <code>MyGui.Show("<a href="Gui.htm#AutoSize">AutoSize</a>")</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Styles (rarely used)</strong>: See the <a href="../misc/Styles.htm#StatusBar">StatusBar styles table</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Known limitations</strong>: 1) Any control that overlaps the status bar might sometimes get drawn on top of it.  One way to avoid this is to dynamically shrink such controls via <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Size">Size</a> event. 2) There is a limit of one status bar per window.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: <a href="TreeView.htm#ExAdvanced">Example #1</a> at the bottom of the TreeView page demonstrates a multipart status bar.</p>
<span id="IE_Control"></span><h2 id="ActiveX">ActiveX</h2>
<p>ActiveX components such as the MSIE browser control can be embedded into a GUI window as follows. For details about the ActiveX component and its method used below, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa752085(v=vs.85)">WebBrowser object (Microsoft Docs)</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa752093(v=vs.85)">Navigate method (Microsoft Docs)</a>.</p>
<pre>MyGui := Gui()
WB := MyGui.Add("ActiveX", "w980 h640", "Shell.Explorer").Value  <em>; The last parameter is the name of the ActiveX component.</em>
WB.Navigate("https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/")  <em>; This is specific to the web browser control.</em>
MyGui.Show()</pre>
<p>When the control is created, the ActiveX object can be retrieved via <a href="GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a>.</p>
<p>To handle events exposed by the object, use <a href="ComObjConnect.htm">ComObjConnect</a> as follows. For details about the event used below, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/aa768334(v=vs.85)">NavigateComplete2 event (Microsoft Docs)</a>.</p>
<pre>MyGui := Gui()
URL := MyGui.Add("Edit", "w930 r1", "https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/")
MyGui.Add("Button", "x+6 yp w44 Default", "Go").OnEvent("Click", ButtonGo)
WB := MyGui.Add("ActiveX", "xm w980 h640", "Shell.Explorer").Value
ComObjConnect(WB, WB_events)  <em>; Connect WB's events to the WB_events class object.</em>
MyGui.Show()
<em>; Continue on to load the initial page:</em>
ButtonGo()

ButtonGo(*) {
    WB.Navigate(URL.Value)
}

class WB_events {
    static NavigateComplete2(wb, &amp;NewURL, *) {
        URL.Value := NewURL  <em>; Update the URL edit control.</em>
    }
}</pre>
<p><a href="ComObjType.htm">ComObjType</a> can be used to determine the type of the retrieved object.</p>

<h2 id="Custom">Custom</h2>
<p>Other controls which are not directly supported by AutoHotkey can be also embedded into a GUI window. In order to do so, include in <em>Options</em> the word <strong>Class</strong> followed by the Win32 class name of the desired control. Examples:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Custom", "ClassComboBoxEx32")  <em>; Adds a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/controls/comboboxex-control-reference">ComboBoxEx</a> control.</em>
MyGui.Add("Custom", "ClassScintilla")  <em>; Adds a <a href="https://scintilla.org/">Scintilla</a> control. Note that the SciLexer.dll library must be loaded before the control can be added.</em></pre>
<p>AutoHotkey uses the standard Windows control text routines when text is to be retrieved/replaced in the control via <code>MyGui.Add</code> or <code>GuiCtrl.Value</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Events</strong>: Since the meaning of each notification code depends on the control which sent it, <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm">OnEvent</a> is not supported for Custom controls. However, if the control sends notifications in the form of a WM_NOTIFY or WM_COMMAND message, the script can use <a href="GuiOnNotify.htm">OnNotify</a> or <a href="GuiOnCommand.htm">OnCommand</a> to detect them.</p>
<p>Here is an example that shows how to add and use an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/controls/ip-address-control-reference">IP address control</a>:</p>
<pre>MyGui := Gui()
IP := MyGui.Add("Custom", "ClassSysIPAddress32 r1 w150")

IP.OnNotify(-860, IP_FieldChange)  <em>; -860 = IPN_FIELDCHANGED</em>
IPText := MyGui.Add("Text", "wp")
IPField := MyGui.Add("Text", "wp y+m")
MyGui.Add("Button", "Default", "OK").OnEvent("Click", OK_Click)
MyGui.Show()

IPCtrlSetAddress(IP, SysGetIPAddresses()[1])

<h1>OnCommand</h1>
<p>Registers a function or method to be called when a control notification is received via the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/menurc/wm-command">WM_COMMAND</a> message.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><a href="GuiControl.htm">GuiCtrl</a>.<span class="func">OnCommand</span>(NotifyCode, Callback <span class="optional">, AddRemove</span>)</pre>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>NotifyCode</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The control-defined notification code to monitor.</p>

  <dt>Callback</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">Function Object</a></p>
    <p>The function, method or object to call when the event is raised.</p>
    <p>If the GUI has an event sink (that is, if <a href="Gui.htm#Call">Gui()</a>'s <em>EventObj</em> parameter was specified), this parameter may be the name of a method belonging to the event sink.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, this parameter must be a <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">function object</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>AddRemove</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If omitted, it defaults to 1 (call the callback after any previously registered callbacks). Otherwise, specify one of the following numbers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 = Call the callback after any previously registered callbacks.</li>
      <li>-1 = Call the callback before any previously registered callbacks.</li>
      <li>0 = Do not call the callback.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="WM_COMMAND">WM_COMMAND</h2>
<p>Certain types of controls send a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/menurc/wm-command">WM_COMMAND</a> message whenever an interesting event occurs. These are usually standard Windows controls which have been around a long time, as newer controls use the WM_NOTIFY message (see <a href="GuiOnNotify.htm">OnNotify</a>). Commonly used notification codes are translated to events, which the script can monitor with <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm">OnEvent</a>.</p>
<p>The message's parameters contain the control ID, HWND and notification code, which AutoHotkey uses to dispatch the notification to the appropriate callback. There are no additional parameters.</p>
<p>To determine which notifications are available (if any), refer to the control's documentation. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/controls/individual-control-info">Control Library (Microsoft Docs)</a> contains links to each of the the Windows common controls (however, only a few of these use WM_COMMAND). The notification codes (numbers) can be found in the Windows SDK, or by searching the Internet.</p>

<h2 id="Callback_Parameters">Callback Parameters</h2>
<p>The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Callback_Parameters">notes for OnEvent</a> regarding <code>this</code> and bound functions also apply to OnCommand.</p>
<p>The callback receives one parameter:</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><i>Callback</i>(GuiControl)</pre>

<h2 id="Callback_Return_Value">Callback Return Value</h2>
<p>If multiple callbacks have been registered for an event, a callback may return a non-empty value to prevent any remaining callbacks from being called.</p>
<p>The return value is ignored by the control.</p>

<h2 id="Related">Related</h2>
<p>These notes for <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm">OnEvent</a> also apply to OnCommand: <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Threads">Threads</a>, <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Destroying_the_GUI">Destroying the GUI</a>.</p>

  <dt>Callback</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">Function Object</a></p>
    <p>The function, method or object to call when the event is raised.</p>
    <p>If the GUI has an event sink (that is, if <a href="Gui.htm#Call">Gui()</a>'s <em>EventObj</em> parameter was specified), this parameter may be the name of a method belonging to the event sink.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1 = Call the callback after any previously registered callbacks.</li>
      <li>-1 = Call the callback before any previously registered callbacks.</li>
      <li>0 = Do not call the callback.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Callback_Parameters">Callback Parameters</h2>
<p>If the callback is a method registered by name, its hidden <a href="../Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_method"><em>this</em> parameter</a> seamlessly receives the event sink object (that is, the object to which the method belongs). This parameter is not shown in the parameter lists in this documentation.</p>
<p>Since <em>Callback</em> can be an object, it can be a <a href="../misc/Functor.htm#BoundFunc">BoundFunc object</a> which inserts additional parameters at the beginning of the parameter list and then calls another function. This is a general technique not specific to OnEvent, so is generally ignored by the rest of this documentation.</p>
<p>The callback's first explicit parameter is the <a href="Gui.htm">Gui</a> or <a href="GuiControl.htm">GuiControl</a> object which raised the event. The only exception is that this parameter is omitted when a Gui <a href="Gui.htm#EventObj">handles its own events</a>, since <code>this</code> already contains a reference to the Gui.</p>
<p>Many events pass additional parameters about the event, as described for each event.</p>
<p>As with all methods or functions called dynamically, the callback is not required to declare parameters which the callback itself does not need, but in this case an asterisk must be specified as the final parameter. If an event has more parameters than are declared by the callback, they will simply be ignored (unless the callback is <a href="../Functions.htm#Variadic">variadic</a>).</p>
<p>The callback can declare more parameters than the event provides if (and only if) the additional parameters are declared optional. However, the use of optional parameters is not recommended as future versions of the program may extend an event with additional parameters, in which case the optional parameters would stop receiving their default values.</p>

<h2 id="Callback_Return_Value">Callback Return Value</h2>
<p>If multiple callbacks have been registered for an event, a callback may return a non-empty value to prevent any remaining callbacks from being called.</p>
<p>The return value may have additional meaning for specific events. For example, a <a href="#Close">Close</a> callback may return a non-zero number (such as <code>true</code>) to prevent the GUI window from closing.</p>

<h2 id="Callback_Name">Callback Name</h2>
<p>By convention, the syntax of each event below is shown with a function name of the form <code><i>ObjectType</i>_<i>EventName</i></code>, for clarity. Scripts are not required to follow this convention, and can use any valid function name.</p>

<h2 id="Threads">Threads</h2>
<p>Each event callback is called in a new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, and therefore starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>. These defaults can be changed during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever a GUI <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> is launched, that thread's <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow">last found window</a> starts off as the GUI window itself. This allows functions for windows and controls -- such as <a href="WinGetStyle.htm">WinGetStyle</a>, <a href="WinSetTransparent.htm">WinSetTransparent</a>, and <a href="ControlGetFocus.htm">ControlGetFocus</a> -- to omit WinTitle and WinText when operating upon the GUI window itself (even if it is hidden).</p>
<p>Except where noted, each event is limited to one thread at a time, per object. If an event is raised before a previous thread started by that event finishes, it is usually discarded. To prevent this, use <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> as the callback's first line (however, this will also buffer/defer other <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> such as the press of a hotkey).</p>

<h2 id="Destroying_the_GUI">Destroying the GUI</h2>
<p>When a GUI is destroyed, all event callbacks are released. Therefore, if the GUI is destroyed while an event is being dispatched, subsequent event callbacks are not called. For clarity, callbacks should <a href="#Callback_Return_Value">return a non-empty value</a> after destroying the GUI.</p>

<h2 id="Events">Events</h2>
<p>The following events are supported by <a href="Gui.htm">Gui</a> objects:</p>
<table class="info">

<pre class="Syntax">Gui_<span class="func">Close</span>(GuiObj)</pre>
<p>By default, the window is automatically hidden after the callback returns, or if no callbacks were registered. A callback can prevent this by returning 1 (or <code>true</code>), which will also prevent any remaining callbacks from being called. The callback can hide the window immediately by calling <a href="Gui.htm#Hide">Gui.Hide</a>, or destroy the window by calling <a href="Gui.htm#Destroy">Gui.Destroy</a>.</p>
<p>For example, this GUI shows a confirmation prompt before closing:</p>
<pre>myGui := Gui()
myGui.AddText("", "Press Alt+F4 or the X button in the title bar.")
myGui.OnEvent("Close", myGui_Close)
myGui_Close(thisGui) {  <em>; Declaring this parameter is optional.</em>
    if MsgBox("Are you sure you want to close the GUI?",, "y/n") = "No"
        return true  <em>; true = 1</em>
}
myGui.Show</pre>

<h3 id="ContextMenu">ContextMenu</h3>
<p>Launched whenever the user right-clicks anywhere in the window except the title bar and menu bar.  It is also launched in response to pressing <kbd>Menu</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd>.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Gui_<span class="func">ContextMenu</span>(GuiObj, GuiCtrlObj, Item, IsRightClick, X, Y)</pre>

    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>When a ListBox, ListView, or TreeView is the target of the context menu (as determined by <em>GuiCtrlObj</em>), <em>Item</em> specifies which of the control's items is the target.</p>
    <p><a href="GuiControls.htm#ListBox">ListBox</a>: The number of the currently focused row. Note that a standard ListBox does not focus an item when it is right-clicked, so this might not be the clicked item.</p>
    <p><a href="ListView.htm">ListView</a> and <a href="TreeView.htm">TreeView</a>: For right-clicks, <em>Item</em> contains the clicked item's ID or row number (or 0 if the user clicked somewhere other than an item). For the AppsKey and Shift-F10, <em>Item</em> contains the selected item's ID or row number.</p></dd>
  <dt>IsRightClick</dt><dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">Integer (boolean)</a></p>
    <p><code>True</code> if the user clicked the right mouse button.<br>
    <code>False</code> if the user pressed <kbd>Menu</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd>.</p></dd>
  <dt>X, Y</dt><dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The X and Y coordinates of where the script should display the menu (e.g. <code>MyContextMenu.<a href="Menu.htm#Show">Show</a> X, Y</code>). Coordinates are relative to the upper-left corner of the window's client area.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Unlike most other GUI events, the ContextMenu event can have more than one concurrent <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>.</p>
<p>Each control can have its own ContextMenu event callback which is called before any callback registered for the Gui object. Control-specific callbacks omit the <em>GuiObj</em> parameter, but all other parameters are the same.</p>
<p>Note: Since <a href="GuiControls.htm#Edit">Edit</a> and <a href="GuiControls.htm#MonthCal">MonthCal</a> controls have their own context menu, a right-click in one of them will not launch the ContextMenu event.</p>

<h3 id="DropFiles">DropFiles</h3>
<p>Launched whenever files/folders are dropped onto the window as part of a drag-and-drop operation (but if this callback is already running, drop events are ignored).</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Gui_<span class="func">DropFiles</span>(GuiObj, GuiCtrlObj, FileArray, X, Y)</pre>
<dl>
  <dt>GuiCtrlObj</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="GuiControl.htm">GuiControl</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#nothing">String (empty)</a></p>

  <dt>FileArray</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="Array.htm">Array</a> of <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">Strings</a></p>
    <p>An array of filenames, where <code>FileArray[1]</code> is the first file and <code>FileArray.Length</code> returns the number of files. A <a href="For.htm">for-loop</a> can be used to iterate through the files:</p>
<pre>Gui_DropFiles(GuiObj, GuiCtrlObj, FileArray, X, Y) {
    for i, DroppedFile in FileArray
        MsgBox "File " i " is:`n" DroppedFile
}</pre></dd>

  <dt>X, Y</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The X and Y coordinates of where the files were dropped, relative to the upper-left corner of the window's client area.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Escape">Escape</h3>
<p>Launched when the user presses <kbd>Esc</kbd> while the GUI window is active.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Gui_<span class="func">Escape</span>(GuiObj)</pre>
<p>By default, pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> has no effect. Known limitation: If the first control in the window is disabled (possibly depending on control type), the Escape event will not be launched. There may be other circumstances that produce this effect.</p>

<h3 id="Size">Size</h3>
<p>Launched when the window is resized, minimized, maximized, or restored.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Gui_<span class="func">Size</span>(GuiObj, MinMax, Width, Height)</pre>
<dl>
  <dt>MinMax</dt><dd>

      <li>0 = The window is neither minimized nor maximized.</li>
      <li>1 = The window is maximized.</li>
      <li>-1 = The window is minimized.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that a maximized window can be resized without restoring/un-maximizing it, so a value of 1 does not necessarily mean that this event was raised in response to the user maximizing the window.</p></dd>
  <dt>Width, Height</dt><dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The new width and height of the window's client area, which is the area excluding title bar, menu bar, and borders.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>A script may use the Size event to reposition and resize controls in response to the user's resizing of the window.</p>
<p>When the window is resized (even by the script), the Size event might not be raised immediately. As with other window events, if the current thread is <a href="Thread.htm#Interrupt">uninterruptible</a>, the Size event won't be raised until the thread becomes interruptible. If the script has just resized the window, follow this example to ensure the Size event is raised immediately:</p>
<pre><a href="Critical.htm#Off">Critical</a> "Off"  <em>; Even if Critical "On" was never used.</em>
<a href="Sleep.htm">Sleep</a> -1</pre>
<p><a href="Gui.htm#Show">Gui.Show</a> automatically does a <code>Sleep -1</code>, so it is generally not necessary to call Sleep in that case.</p>

<h1>OnNotify</h1>
<p>Registers a function or method to be called when a control notification is received via the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/controls/wm-notify">WM_NOTIFY</a> message.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><a href="GuiControl.htm">GuiCtrl</a>.<span class="func">OnNotify</span>(NotifyCode, Callback <span class="optional">, AddRemove</span>)</pre>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>NotifyCode</dt>

  <dt>Callback</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">Function Object</a></p>
    <p>The function, method or object to call when the event is raised.</p>
    <p>If the GUI has an event sink (that is, if <a href="Gui.htm#Call">Gui()</a>'s <em>EventObj</em> parameter was specified), this parameter may be the name of a method belonging to the event sink.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, this parameter must be a <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">function object</a>.</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>AddRemove</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If omitted, it defaults to 1 (call the callback after any previously registered callbacks). Otherwise, specify one of the following numbers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 = Call the callback after any previously registered callbacks.</li>
      <li>-1 = Call the callback before any previously registered callbacks.</li>
      <li>0 = Do not call the callback.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="WM_NOTIFY">WM_NOTIFY</h2>
<p>Certain types of controls send a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/controls/wm-notify">WM_NOTIFY</a> message whenever an interesting event occurs or the control requires information from the program. The <em>lParam</em> parameter of this message contains a pointer to a structure containing information about the notification. The type of structure depends on the notification code and the type of control which raised the notification, but is always based on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-nmhdr">NMHDR</a>.</p>
<p>To determine which notifications are available (if any), what type of structure they provide and how they interpret the return value, refer to the control's documentation. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/controls/individual-control-info">Control Library (Microsoft Docs)</a> contains links to each of the the Windows common controls. The notification codes (numbers) can be found in the Windows SDK, or by searching the Internet.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey uses the <em>idFrom</em> and <em>hwndFrom</em> fields to identify which control sent the notification, in order to dispatch it to the appropriate object. The <em>code</em> field contains the notification code. Since these must match up to the <em>GuiControl</em> and <em>NotifyCode</em> used to register the callback, they are rarely useful to the script.</p>

<h2 id="Callback_Parameters">Callback Parameters</h2>
<p>The <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Callback_Parameters">notes for OnEvent</a> regarding <code>this</code> and bound functions also apply to OnNotify.</p>
<p>The callback receives two parameters:</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><i>Callback</i>(GuiControl, lParam)</pre>
<p>As noted above, <em>lParam</em> is the address of a notification structure derived from <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/richedit/ns-richedit-nmhdr">NMHDR</a>. Its exact type depends on the type of control and notification code. If the structure contains additional information about the notification, the callback can retrieve it with <a href="NumGet.htm">NumGet</a> and/or <a href="StrGet.htm">StrGet</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Callback_Return_Value">Callback Return Value</h2>
<p>If multiple callbacks have been registered for an event, a callback may return a non-empty value to prevent any remaining callbacks from being called.</p>
<p>The return value may have additional meaning, depending on the notification. For example, the ListView notification <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/controls/lvn-beginlabeledit">LVN_BEGINLABELEDIT</a> (-175 or -105) prevents the user from editing the label if the callback returns TRUE (1).</p>

<h2 id="Related">Related</h2>
<p>These notes for <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm">OnEvent</a> also apply to OnNotify: <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Threads">Threads</a>, <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#Destroying_the_GUI">Destroying the GUI</a>.</p>
<p><a href="GuiOnCommand.htm">OnCommand</a> can be used for notifications which are sent as a WM_COMMAND message.</p>

<p>This function returns true if <em>BaseObj</em> is in <em>Value</em>'s chain of base objects, otherwise false.</p>

<p>The following code is roughly equivalent to this function:</p>

    while b := ObjGetBase(b)
        if b = BaseObj
            return true
    return false
}</pre>
<p>For example, <code>HasBase(Obj, Array.Prototype)</code> is true if <em>Obj</em> is an instance of Array or any derived class. This the same check performed by <code>Obj is Array</code>; however, instances can be based on other instances, whereas <code>is</code> requires a Class.</p>
<p>HasBase accepts both objects and <a href="../Objects.htm#primitive">primitive values</a>. For example, <code>HasBase(1, 0.base)</code> returns true.</p>

<p>This function can be used to estimate whether a value supports a specific action. For example, values without a Call method cannot be called or passed to <a href="SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a>, while values without either an __Enum method or a Call method cannot be passed to <a href="For.htm">For</a>. However, the existence of a method does not guarantee that it can be called, since there are requirements that must be met, such as parameter count.</p>
<p>When <em>ParamCount</em> is specified, the validation this function performs is equivalent to the validation performed by built-in functions such as <a href="SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a>.</p>
<p>A return value of false does not necessarily indicate that the method cannot be called, as the value may have a __Call <a href="../Objects.htm#Meta_Functions">meta-function</a>. However, __Call is not triggered in certain contexts, such as when __Enum is being called by <a href="For.htm">For</a>. If __Call is present, there is no way to detect which methods it may support.</p>

<p>An exception is thrown if HotIf's parameter is invalid, such as if it does not match an existing expression and is not a valid callback function.</p>

<h2 id="remarks">General Remarks</h2>
<p>HotIf allows context-sensitive <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> to be created and modified while the script is running (by contrast, the <a href="_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> directive is positional and takes effect before the script begins executing). For example:</p>
<pre>HotIfWinActive "ahk_class Notepad"
Hotkey "^!e", MyFuncForNotepad  <em>; Creates a hotkey that works only in Notepad.</em></pre>
<p>Using HotIf puts context sensitivity into effect for all subsequently created <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> in the current <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, and affects which hotkey variants the <a href="Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> function modifies. Only the most recent call to any of the HotIf functions in the current thread will be in effect.</p>
<p>To turn off context sensitivity (such as to make subsequently-created hotkeys work in all windows), call any HotIf function but omit the parameters. For example: <code>HotIf</code> or <code>HotIfWinActive</code>.</p>
<p>Before HotIf is used in a hotkey or hotstring <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, the Hotkey and Hotstring functions default to the same context as the hotkey or hotstring that launched the thread. In other words, <code>Hotkey A_ThisHotkey, "Off"</code> turns off the current hotkey even if it is context-sensitive. All other threads default to creating or modifying global hotkeys, unless that default is overridden by using HotIf during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>.</p>
<p>When a mouse or keyboard hotkey is disabled via a HotIf function or directive, it performs its native function; that is, it passes through to the active window as though there is no such hotkey. However, joystick hotkeys always pass through, whether they are disabled or not.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>KeyName</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>Name of the hotkey's activation key, including any <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Symbols">modifier symbols</a>. For example, specify <code>#c</code> for the <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> hotkey.</p>
    <p>If <em>KeyName</em> already exists as a hotkey, that hotkey will be updated with the values of the function's other parameters.</p>
    <p><em>KeyName</em> can also be the name of an existing hotkey (created with the double-colon syntax), which will cause that hotkey to be updated with the values of the function's other parameters.</p>
    <p>When specifying an <em>existing</em> hotkey, <em>KeyName</em> is not case sensitive. However, the names of keys must be spelled the same as in the existing hotkey (e.g. Esc is not the same as Escape for this purpose). Also, the order of <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Symbols">modifier symbols</a> such as ^!+# does not matter. <a href="GetKeyName.htm">GetKeyName</a> can be used to retrieve the standard spelling of a key name.</p>
    <p>When a hotkey is first created -- either by the Hotkey function or the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">double-colon syntax</a> in the script -- its key name and the ordering of its modifier symbols becomes the permanent name of that hotkey as reflected by <a href="../Variables.htm#ThisHotkey">A_ThisHotkey</a> and <em>Action</em>'s parameter. This name is shared by all <a href="_HotIf.htm#variant">variants</a> of the hotkey, and does not change even if the Hotkey function later accesses the hotkey with a different symbol ordering.</p>
    <p>If the hotkey variant already exists, its behavior is updated according to whether <em>KeyName</em> includes or excludes the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Tilde">tilde (~) prefix</a>.</p>
    <p>The <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#prefixdollar">use hook ($) prefix</a> can be added to existing hotkeys. This prefix affects all variants of the hotkey and cannot be removed.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Action</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">Function Object</a></p>
      <p>An action name or a function to execute (as a new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>) when the hotkey is pressed. This can be a <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">function object</a>, a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> name without trailing colons, or one of the special values listed below.</p>
      <p>If <em>Action</em> is a function, it is called with one parameter, the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#ThisHotkey">name</a> of the hotkey. Hotkeys defined with the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">double-colon syntax</a> automatically use the parameter name <code>ThisHotkey</code>. Hotkeys can also be <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Function">assigned a function name</a> without the Hotkey function.</p>
      <p>If <em>Action</em> is a hotkey name, its original function is used; specifically, the original function of the hotkey variant corresponding to the current <a href="HotIf.htm">HotIf</a> criteria. This is usually used to restore a hotkey's original function after having changed it, but can be used to assign the function of a different hotkey, provided that both hotkeys use the same HotIf criteria.</p>
      <p>This parameter can be left blank if <em>KeyName</em> already exists as a hotkey, in which case its action will not be changed. This is useful to change only the hotkey's <em>Options</em>.</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the function is specified but the hotkey is disabled from a previous use of this function, the hotkey will remain disabled. To prevent this, include the word ON in <em>Options</em>.</p>
      <p>This parameter can also be one of the following special values:</p>
      <p><strong>On</strong>: The hotkey becomes enabled. No action is taken if the hotkey is already On.</p>
      <p><strong>Off</strong>: The hotkey becomes disabled. No action is taken if the hotkey is already Off.</p>
      <p><strong>Toggle</strong>: The hotkey is set to the opposite state (enabled or disabled).</p>
      <p><strong>AltTab</strong> (and others): These are special Alt-Tab hotkey actions that are described <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#alttab">here</a>.</p>
      </dd>

  <dt id="Options">Options</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>A string of zero or more of the following letters with optional spaces in between. For example: <code>On B0</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>On</strong>: Enables the hotkey if it is currently disabled.</p>
      <p><strong>Off</strong>: Disables the hotkey if it is currently enabled. This is typically used to create a hotkey in an initially-disabled state.</p>
      <p><strong>B</strong> or <strong>B0</strong>: Specify the letter B to buffer the hotkey as described in <a href="_MaxThreadsBuffer.htm">#MaxThreadsBuffer</a>. Specify B0 (B with the number 0) to disable this type of buffering.</p>
      <p><strong>Pn</strong>: Specify the letter P followed by the hotkey's <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread priority</a>. If the P option is omitted when creating a hotkey, 0 will be used.</p>
      <p id="SuspendExempt"><strong>S</strong> or <strong>S0</strong>: Specify the letter S to make the hotkey <a href="_SuspendExempt.htm">exempt</a> from <a href="Suspend.htm">Suspend</a>, which allows the hotkey to be used to turn Suspend off. Specify S0 (S with the number 0) to remove the exemption, allowing the hotkey to be suspended.</p>
      <p><strong>Tn</strong>: Specify the letter T followed by a the number of threads to allow for this hotkey as described in <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a>. For example: <code>T5</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>In</strong> (InputLevel): Specify the letter I (or i) followed by the hotkey's <a href="_InputLevel.htm">input level</a>. For example: <code>I1</code>.</p>
      <p>If any of the option letters are omitted and the hotkey already exists, those options will not be changed. But if the hotkey does not yet exist -- that is, it is about to be created by this function -- the options will default to those most recently in effect. For example, the instance of <a href="_MaxThreadsBuffer.htm">#MaxThreadsBuffer</a> that occurs closest to the bottom of the script will be used. If <a href="_MaxThreadsBuffer.htm">#MaxThreadsBuffer</a> does not appear in the script, its default setting (OFF in this case) will be used.</p>
      </dd>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>Tip: <a href="Try.htm">Try</a>-<a href="Catch.htm">Catch</a> can be used to test for the existence of a hotkey variant. For example:</p>
<pre>
try
    Hotkey "^!p"
catch TargetError
    MsgBox "The hotkey does not exist or it has no variant for the current If criteria."
</pre>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The <a href="HotIf.htm">current HotIf setting</a> determines the <a href="#variant">variant</a> of a hotkey upon which the Hotkey function will operate.</p>
<p>If the goal is to disable selected hotkeys or hotstrings automatically based on the type of window that is active, <code>Hotkey "^!c", "Off"</code> is usually less convenient than using <a href="_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> with <a href="WinActive.htm">WinActive</a>/<a href="WinExist.htm">WinExist</a> (or their dynamic counterparts <a href="HotIf.htm#IfWin">HotIfWinActive/Exist</a>).</p>
<p>Creating hotkeys via the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">double-colon syntax</a> performs better than using the Hotkey function because the hotkeys can all be enabled as a batch when the script starts (rather than one by one). Therefore, it is best to use this function to create only those hotkeys whose key names are not known until after the script has started running. One such case is when a script's hotkeys for various actions are configurable via an <a href="IniRead.htm">INI file</a>.</p>
<p>If the script is <a href="Suspend.htm">suspended</a>, newly added/enabled hotkeys will also be suspended until the suspension is turned off (unless they are exempt as described in the <a href="Suspend.htm">Suspend</a> section).</p>
<p>The <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard</a> and/or <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse</a> hooks will be installed or removed if justified by the changes made by this function.</p>
<p>Although the Hotkey function cannot directly enable or disable hotkeys in scripts other than its own, in most cases it can <a href="../misc/Override.htm">override</a> them by creating or enabling the same hotkeys. Whether this works depends on a combination of factors: 1) Whether the hotkey to be overridden is a <a href="ListHotkeys.htm">hook hotkey</a> in the other script (non-hook hotkeys can always be overridden); 2) The fact that the most recently started script's hotkeys generally take precedence over those in other scripts (therefore, if the script intending to override was started most recently, its override should always succeed);  3) Whether the enabling or creating of this hotkey will newly activate the <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard</a> or <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse</a> hook (if so, the override will always succeed).</p>
<p>Once a script has at least one hotkey, it becomes <a href="../Scripts.htm#persistent">persistent</a>, meaning that <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> rather than Exit should be used to terminate it.</p>

<h2 id="variant">Variant (Duplicate) Hotkeys</h2>
<p>A particular hotkey can be created more than once if each definition has different If criteria. These are known as <em>hotkey variants</em>. For example:</p>
<pre>HotIfWinActive "ahk_class Notepad"
Hotkey "^!c", MyFuncForNotepad
HotIfWinActive "ahk_class WordPadClass"
Hotkey "^!c", MyFuncForWordPad
HotIfWinActive
Hotkey "^!c", MyFuncForAllOtherWindows</pre>
<p>If more than one variant of a hotkey is eligible to fire, only the one created earliest will fire. The exception to this is the global variant (the one with no If criteria): It always has the lowest precedence, and thus will fire only if no other variant is eligible.</p>
<p>When creating duplicate hotkeys, the order of <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Symbols">modifier symbols</a> such as ^!+# does not matter. For example, <code>"^!c"</code> is the same as <code>"!^c"</code>. However, keys must be spelled consistently. For example, <em>Esc</em> is not the same as <em>Escape</em> for this purpose (though the case does not matter). Finally, any hotkey with a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#wildcard">wildcard prefix (*)</a> is entirely separate from a non-wildcard one; for example, <code>"*F1"</code> and <code>"F1"</code> would each have their own set of variants.</p>

<h1>Hotstring</h1>

<p>Creates, modifies, enables, or disables a <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstring</a> while the script is running.</p>

<span class="func">Hotstring</span> <a href="#NewOptions">NewOptions</a>

</pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>String</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The hotstring's trigger string, preceded by <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">the usual colons</a> and <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#Options">option characters</a>. For example, <code>"::btw"</code> or <code>":*:]d"</code>.</p>
    <p><em>String</em> may be matched to an existing hotstring by considering <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#C">case-sensitivity (C)</a>, <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#Question">word-sensitivity (?)</a>, activation criteria (as set by <a href="_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> or <a href="HotIf.htm">HotIf</a>) and the trigger string. For example, <code>"::btw"</code> and <code>"::BTW"</code> match unless the case-sensitive mode was enabled as a default, while <code>":C:btw"</code> and <code>":C:BTW"</code> never match. The <code>C</code> and <code>?</code> options may be included in <em>String</em> or set as defaults by the <a href="_Hotstring.htm">#Hotstring</a> directive or a previous call to <a href="#NewOptions">this function</a>.</p>
    <p>If the hotstring already exists, any options specified in <em>String</em> are put into effect, while all other options are left as is. However, since hotstrings with <code>C</code> or <code>?</code> are considered distinct from other hotstrings, it is not possible to add or remove these options. Instead, turn off the existing hotstring and create a new one.</p>
    <p>When a hotstring is first created -- either by the Hotstring function or the <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">double-colon syntax</a> in the script -- its trigger string and sequence of option characters becomes the permanent name of that hotstring as reflected by <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#ThisHotkey">ThisHotkey</a>. This name does not change even if the Hotstring function later accesses the hotstring with different option characters.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Replacement</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">Function Object</a></p>
    <p>The replacement string, or a <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a> or <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">function object</a> to call (as a new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>) when the hotstring triggers.</p>
    <p>If <em>Replacement</em> is a function, it is called with one parameter, the <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#ThisHotkey">name</a> of the hotstring. Hotstrings defined with the <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">double-colon syntax</a> automatically use the parameter name <code>ThisHotkey</code>. Hotstrings can also be <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#Function">assigned a function name</a> without the Hotstring function.</p>
    <p>All strings are treated as replacement text. To make a hotstring call a function when triggered, pass the function by reference. Note that after reassigning the function of a hotstring, its original function can only be restored if it was <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#Function">given a name</a>.</p>
    <p>This parameter can be omitted if the hotstring already exists, in which case its replacement will not be changed. This is useful to change only the hotstring's options, or to turn it on or off.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If this parameter is specified but the hotstring is disabled from a previous use of this function, the hotstring will remain disabled. To prevent this, include the word <code>"On"</code> in <em>OnOffToggle</em>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>OnOffToggle</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>One of the following values:</p>
    <p><strong>On</strong> or <strong>1</strong> (true): Enables the hotstring.</p>
    <p><strong>Off</strong> or <strong>0</strong> (false): Disables the hotstring.</p>
    <p><strong>Toggle</strong> or <strong>-1</strong>: Sets the hotstring to the opposite state (enabled or disabled).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Errors">Errors</h2>
<p>This function throws an exception if the parameters are invalid or a memory allocation fails.</p>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#TargetError">TargetError</a> is thrown if <em>Replacement</em> is omitted and <em>String</em> is valid but does not match an existing hotstring. This can be utilized to test for the existence of a hotstring. For example:</p>
<pre>try
    Hotstring "::btw"
catch TargetError
    MsgBox "The hotstring does not exist or it has no variant for the current IfWin criteria."</pre>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The <a href="HotIf.htm">current HotIf setting</a> determines the <a href="#variant">variant</a> of a hotstring upon which the Hotstring function will operate.</p>
<p>If the script is <a href="Suspend.htm">suspended</a>, newly added/enabled hotstrings will also be suspended until the suspension is turned off (unless they are exempt as described in the <a href="Suspend.htm">Suspend</a> section).</p>
<p>The <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard</a> and/or <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse</a> hooks will be installed or removed if justified by the changes made by this function.</p>
<p>This function cannot directly enable or disable hotstrings in scripts other than its own.</p>
<p>Once a script has at least one hotstring, it becomes persistent, meaning that <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> rather than Exit should be used to terminate it. Hotstring scripts are also automatically <a href="_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a> unless <code>#SingleInstance Off</code> has been specified.</p>

<h2 id="variant">Variant (Duplicate) Hotstrings</h2>
<p>A particular hotstring can be created more than once if each definition has different <a href="HotIf.htm">HotIf</a> criteria, <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#C">case-sensitivity</a> (<code>C</code> vs. <code>C0</code>/<code>C1</code>), or <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#Question">word-sensitivity</a> (<code>?</code>). These are known as <em>hotstring variants</em>. For example:</p>
<pre>HotIfWinActive "ahk_group CarForums"
Hotstring "::btw", "behind the wheel"
HotIfWinActive "Inter-Office Chat"
Hotstring "::btw", "back to work"
HotIfWinActive
Hotstring "::btw", "by the way"</pre>
<p>If more than one variant of a hotstring is eligible to fire, only the one created earliest will fire.</p>
<p>For more information about IfWin, see <a href="_HotIf.htm#general-remarks">#HotIf's General Remarks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="EndChars">EndChars</h2>
<pre class="Syntax">OldValue := <span class="func">Hotstring</span>("EndChars" <span class="optional">, NewValue</span>)</pre>
<p>Retrieves or modifies the set of characters used as <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#EndChars">ending characters</a> by the hotstring recognizer. For example:</p>
<pre>prev_chars := Hotstring("EndChars", "-()[]{}':;`"/\,.?!`n `t")
MsgBox "The previous value was: " prev_chars</pre>
<p><a href="Hotstring.htm#EndChars">#Hotstring EndChars</a> also affects this setting.</p>
<p>It is currently not possible to specify a different set of end characters for each hotstring.</p>

<h2 id="MouseReset">MouseReset</h2>
<pre class="Syntax">OldValue := <span class="func">Hotstring</span>("MouseReset" <span class="optional">, NewValue</span>)</pre>
<p>Retrieves or modifies the global setting which controls whether mouse clicks reset the hotstring recognizer, as described <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#NoMouse">here</a>. <em>NewValue</em> should be 1 (true) to enable mouse click detection and resetting of the hotstring recognizer, or 0 (false) to disable it. The return value is the setting which was in effect before the function was called.</p>
<p>The <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse</a> hook may be installed or removed if justified by the changes made by this function.</p>
<p><a href="_Hotstring.htm">#Hotstring NoMouse</a> also affects this setting, and is equivalent to specifying <code>false</code> for <em>NewValue</em>.</p>

<h2 id="Reset">Reset</h2>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Hotstring</span> "Reset"</pre>
<p>Immediately resets the hotstring recognizer. In other words, the script will begin waiting for an entirely new hotstring, eliminating from consideration anything you previously typed.</p>

<h2 id="NewOptions">Setting Default Options</h2>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Hotstring</span> NewOptions</pre>
<p>To set new default options for subsequently created hotstrings, pass the options to the Hotstring function without any leading or trailing colon. For example: <code>Hotstring "T"</code>.</p>
<p>Turning on <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#C">case-sensitivity (C)</a> or <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#Question">word-sensitivity (?)</a> also affects which existing hotstrings will be found by any subsequent calls to the Hotstring function. For example, <code>Hotstring ":T:btw"</code> will find <code>::BTW</code> by default, but not if <code>Hotstring "C"</code> or <code><a href="_Hotstring.htm">#Hotstring</a> C</code> is in effect. This can be undone or overridden by passing a mutually-exclusive option; for example, <code>C0</code> and <code>C1</code> override <code>C</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>If the <em>If</em> statement's expression evaluates to true (which is any result other than an empty string or the number 0), the line or <a href="Block.htm">block</a> underneath it is executed. Otherwise, if there is a corresponding <a href="Else.htm">Else</a> statement, execution jumps to the line or block underneath it.</p>
<p>If an <em>If</em> owns more than one line, those lines must be enclosed in braces (to create a <a href="Block.htm">block</a>). However, if only one line belongs to an <em>If</em>, the braces are optional. See the examples at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>The space after <code>if</code> is optional if the expression starts with an open-parenthesis, as in <code>if(expression)</code>.</p>
<p id="otb">The One True Brace (OTB) style may optionally be used. For example:</p>

  <dt>&amp;OutputVarX, &amp;OutputVarY</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a></p>
    <p>References to the output variables in which to store the X and Y coordinates of the upper-left pixel of where the image was found on the screen (if no match is found, the variables are made blank).

  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The X and Y coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle to search. Coordinates are relative to the active window's client area unless <a href="CoordMode.htm">CoordMode</a> was used to change that.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>X2, Y2</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The X and Y coordinates of the lower right corner of the rectangle to search. Coordinates are relative to the active window's client area unless <a href="CoordMode.htm">CoordMode</a> was used to change that.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>ImageFile</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The file name of an image, which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified. Supported image formats include ANI, BMP, CUR, EMF, Exif, GIF, ICO, JPG, PNG, TIF, and WMF (BMP images must be 16-bit or higher). Other sources of icons include the following types of files: EXE, DLL, CPL, SCR, and other types that contain icon resources.</p>
      <p><strong>Options</strong>: Zero or more of the following strings may be also be present immediately before the name of the file. Separate each option from the next with a single space or tab. For example: <code>"*2 *w100 *h-1 C:\Main Logo.bmp"</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>*IconN</strong>: To use an icon group other than the first one in the file, specify <code>*Icon</code> followed immediately by the number of the group. For example, <code>*Icon2</code> would load the default icon from the second icon group.</p>
    <p><strong>*n</strong> (variation): Specify for <strong>n</strong> a number between 0 and 255 (inclusive) to indicate the allowed number of shades of variation in either direction for the intensity of the red, green, and blue components of each pixel's color. For example, if <code>*2</code> is specified and the color of a pixel is 0x444444, any color from 0x424242 to 0x464646 will be considered a match. This parameter is helpful if the coloring of the image varies slightly or if <em>ImageFile</em> uses a format such as GIF or JPG that does not accurately represent an image on the screen. If you specify 255 shades of variation, all colors will match. The default is 0 shades.</p>
    <p><strong>*TransN</strong>: This option makes it easier to find a match by specifying one color within the image that will match any color on the screen. It is most commonly used to find PNG, GIF, and TIF files that have some transparent areas (however, icons do not need this option because their transparency is automatically supported). For GIF files, <code>*TransWhite</code> might be most likely to work. For PNG and TIF files, <code>*TransBlack</code> might be best. Otherwise, specify for <strong>N</strong> some other color name or RGB value (see the <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">color chart</a> for guidance, or use <a href="PixelGetColor.htm">PixelGetColor</a> in its RGB mode). Examples: <code>*TransBlack</code>, <code>*TransFFFFAA</code>, <code>*Trans0xFFFFAA</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>*wn</strong> and <strong>*hn</strong>: Width and height to which to scale the image (this width and height also determines which icon to load from a multi-icon .ICO file). If both these options are omitted, icons loaded from ICO, DLL, or EXE files are scaled to the system's default small-icon size, which is usually 16 by 16 (you can force the actual/internal size to be used by specifying <code>*w0 *h0</code>). Images that are not icons are loaded at their actual size. To shrink or enlarge the image while preserving its aspect ratio, specify -1 for one of the dimensions and a positive number for the other. For example, specifying <code>*w200 *h-1</code> would make the image 200 pixels wide and cause its height to be set automatically.</p>
    <p>A <a href="../misc/ImageHandles.htm">bitmap or icon handle</a> can be used instead of a filename. For example, <code>"HBITMAP:*" handle</code>.</p>
  </dd>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">Integer (boolean)</a></p>
<p>This function returns 1 (true) if the image was found in the specified region, or 0 (false) if it was not found.</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#ValueError">ValueError</a> is thrown if an invalid parameter was detected or the image could not be loaded.</p>
<p>An <a href="Error.htm#OSError">OSError</a> is thrown if an internal function call fails.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>ImageSearch can be used to detect graphical objects on the screen that either lack text or whose text cannot be easily retrieved. For example, it can be used to discover the position of picture buttons, icons, web page links, or game objects. Once located, such objects can be clicked via <a href="Click.htm">Click</a>.</p>
<p>A strategy that is sometimes useful is to search for a small clipping from an image rather than the entire image. This can improve reliability in cases where the image as a whole varies, but certain parts within it are always the same. One way to extract a clipping is to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>PrtSc</kbd> while the image is visible in the active window. This places a screenshot on the clipboard.</li>
  <li>Open an image processing program such as Paint.</li>
  <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard (that is, the screenshot).</li>
  <li>Select a region that does not vary and that is unique to the image.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste that region to a new image document.</li>
  <li>Save it as a small file for use with ImageSearch.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be a match, an image on the screen must be the same size as the one loaded via the <em>ImageFile</em> parameter and its options.</p>
<p>The region to be searched must be visible; in other words, it is not possible to  search a region of a window hidden behind another window. By contrast, images that lie partially beneath the mouse cursor can usually be detected. The exception to this is game cursors, which in most cases will obstruct any images beneath them.</p>
<p>Since the search starts at the top row of the region and moves downward, if there is more than one match, the one closest to the top will be found.</p>
<p>Icons containing a transparent color automatically allow that color to match any color on the screen. Therefore, the color of what lies behind the icon does not matter.</p>
<p>ImageSearch supports 8-bit color screens (256-color) or higher.</p>
<p>The search behavior may vary depending on the display adapter's color depth (especially for GIF and JPG files). Therefore, if a script will run under multiple color depths, it is best to test it on each depth setting. You can use the shades-of-variation option (*n) to help make the behavior consistent across multiple color depths.</p>
<p>If the image on the screen is translucent, ImageSearch will probably fail to find it. To work around this, try the shades-of-variation option (*n) or make the window temporarily opaque via <code><a href="WinSetTransparent.htm">WinSetTransparent</a>("Off")</code>.</p>

      <p>A string of case-insensitive options, with each separated from the last by a space or tab.</p>
      <p><strong>Xn Yn:</strong> The X and Y coordinates of the dialog. For example, <em>X0 Y0</em> puts the window at the upper left corner of the desktop. If either coordinate is omitted, the dialog will be centered in that dimension. Either coordinate can be negative to position the dialog partially or entirely off the desktop (or on a secondary monitor in a multi-monitor setup).</p>
      <p><strong>Wn Hn:</strong> The width and height of the dialog's client area, which excludes the title bar and borders. For example, <em>W200 H100</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>T:</strong> Specifies the timeout in seconds. For example, <em>T10.0</em> is ten seconds. If this value exceeds 2147483 (24.8 days), it will be set to 2147483. After the timeout has elapsed, the input box will be automatically closed and <a href="#return">Result</a> will be set to word "Timeout". <a href="#return">Value</a> will still contain what the user entered.</p>
      <p><strong>Password:</strong> Mask the user's input. To specify which character is used, follow this example: <em>Password*</em></p>

    <p id="option-m"><strong>M</strong>: Modified keystrokes such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> through <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> are recognized and transcribed if they correspond to real ASCII characters. Consider this example, which recognizes <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>:</p>
    <pre>CtrlC := Chr(3) <em>; Store the character for Ctrl-C in the CtrlC var.</em>
ih := InputHook("L1 M")
ih.Start()
ih.Wait()
if (ih.Input = CtrlC)
    MsgBox "You pressed Control-C."</pre>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The characters <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> through <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> correspond to <a href="Chr.htm">Chr(1)</a> through <a href="Chr.htm">Chr(26)</a>. Also, the <strong>M</strong> option might cause some keyboard shortcuts such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&larr;</kbd> to misbehave while an Input is in progress.</p>
    <p id="option-t"><strong>T</strong>: Sets <a href="#Timeout">Timeout</a> (e.g. <code>T3</code> or <code>T2.5</code>).</p>
    <p id="vis"><strong>V</strong>: Sets <a href="#VisibleText">VisibleText</a> and <a href="#VisibleNonText">VisibleNonText</a> to true. Normally, the user's input is blocked (hidden from the system). Use this option to have the user's keystrokes sent to the active window.</p>
    <p id="asterisk"><strong>*</strong>: Wildcard. Sets <a href="#FindAnywhere">FindAnywhere</a> to true, allowing matches to be found anywhere within what the user types.</p>
    <p id="E"><strong>E</strong>: Handle single-character end keys by character code instead of by keycode. This provides more consistent results if the active window's keyboard layout is different to the script's keyboard layout. It also prevents key combinations which don't actually produce the given end characters from ending input; for example, if <code>@</code> is an end key, on the US layout <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> will trigger it but <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> will not (if the E option is used). If the <strong>C</strong> option is also used, the end character is case-sensitive.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="EndKeys">EndKeys</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>A list of zero or more keys, any one of which terminates the Input when pressed (the end key itself is not written to the Input buffer). When an Input is terminated this way, EndReason is set to the word EndKey and the <a href="#EndKey">EndKey</a> property is set to the name of the key.</p>
    <p>The <em>EndKeys</em> list uses a format similar to the <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> function. For example, specifying <code>{Enter}.{Esc}</code> would cause either <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>.</kbd>, or <kbd>Esc</kbd> to terminate the Input. To use the braces themselves as end keys, specify <code>{{}</code> and/or <code>{}}</code>.</p>
    <p>To use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, or <kbd>Shift</kbd> as end-keys, specify the left and/or right version of the key, not the neutral version. For example, specify <code>{LControl}{RControl}</code> rather than <code>{Control}</code>.</p>
    <p>Although modified keys such as <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (!c) are not supported, non-alphanumeric characters such as <code>?!:@&amp;{}</code> by default require the Shift key to be pressed or not pressed depending on how the character is normally typed. If the <strong>E</strong> option is present, single character key names are interpreted as characters instead, and in those cases the modifier keys must be in the correct state to produce that character. When the <strong>E</strong> and <strong>M</strong> options are both used, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> through <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> are supported by including the corresponding ASCII control characters in <em>EndKeys</em>.</p>
    <p>An explicit key code such as <code>{vkFF}</code> or <code>{sc001}</code> may also be specified. This is useful in the rare case where a key has no name and produces no visible character when pressed. Its virtual key code can be determined by following the steps at the bottom fo the <a href="../KeyList.htm#SpecialKeys">key list page</a>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="MatchList">MatchList</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>A comma-separated list of key phrases, any of which will cause the Input to be terminated (in which case EndReason will be set to the word Match). The entirety of what the user types must exactly match one of the phrases for a match to occur (unless the <a href="#asterisk">* option</a> is present). In addition, <strong>any spaces or tabs around the delimiting commas are significant</strong>, meaning that they are part of the match string. For example, if <em>MatchList</em> is <code>ABC , XYZ</code>, the user must type a space after ABC or before XYZ to cause a match.</p>
    <p>Two consecutive commas results in a single literal comma. For example, the following would produce a single literal comma at the end of string: <code>string1,,,string2</code>. Similarly, the following list contains only a single item with a literal comma inside it: <code>single,,item</code>.</p>
    <p>Because the items in <em>MatchList</em> are not treated as individual parameters, the list can be contained entirely within a variable. For example, <em>MatchList</em> might consist of <code>List1 "," List2 "," List3</code> -- where each of the variables  contains a large sub-list of match phrases.</p>

<h2 id="stack">Input Stack</h2>
<p>Any number of InputHook objects can be created and in progress at any time, but the order in which they are started affects how input is collected.</p>
<p>When each Input is started (by the <a href="#Start">Start</a> method), it is pushed onto the top of a stack, and is removed from this stack only when the Input is terminated. Keyboard events are passed to each Input in order of most recently started to least. If an Input suppresses a given keyboard event, it is passed no further down the stack.</p>
<p><a href="Send.htm">Sent</a> keystrokes are ignored if the <a href="SendLevel.htm">send level</a> of the keystroke is below the InputHook's <a href="#MinSendLevel">MinSendLevel</a>. In such cases, the keystroke may still be processed by an Input lower on the stack.</p>
<p>Multiple InputHooks can be used in combination with <a href="#MinSendLevel">MinSendLevel</a> to separately collect both sent keystrokes and real ones.</p>

<h2 id="object">InputHook Object</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Keys</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
  <p>A list of keys. Braces are used to enclose key names, virtual key codes or scan codes, similar to the <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> function. For example, <code>{Enter}.{{}</code> would apply to <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>.</kbd> and <kbd>{</kbd>. Specifying a key by name, by <code>{vkNN}</code> or by <code>{scNNN}</code> may produce three different results; see below for details.</p>
  <p id="all-keys">Specify the string <code>{All}</code> (case-insensitive) on its own to apply <em>KeyOptions</em> to all VK and all SC. KeyOpt may then be called a second time to remove options from specific keys.</p></dd>
  <dt>KeyOptions</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
  <p>One or more of the following single-character options (spaces and tabs are ignored).</p>
  <p id="KeyOpt-minus"><strong>-</strong> (minus): Removes any of the options following the <code>-</code>, up to the next <code>+</code>.</p>
  <p id="KeyOpt-plus"><strong>+</strong> (plus): Cancels any previous <code>-</code>, otherwise has no effect.</p>
  <p id="KeyOpt-e"><strong>E</strong>: End key. If enabled, pressing the key terminates Input, sets <a href="#EndReason">EndReason</a> to the word EndKey and the <a href="#EndKey">EndKey</a> property to the key's normalized name. Unlike the <em>EndKeys</em> parameter, the state of the Shift key is ignored. For example, <code>@</code> and <code>2</code> are both equivalent to <code>{vk32}</code> on the US keyboard layout.</p>
  <p id="KeyOpt-i"><strong>I</strong>: Ignore text. Any text normally produced by this key is ignored, and the key is treated as a non-text key (see <a href="#VisibleNonText">VisibleNonText</a>). Has no effect if the key normally does not produce text.</p>
  <p id="KeyOpt-n"><strong>N</strong>: Notify. Causes the <a href="#OnKeyDown">OnKeyDown</a> and <a href="#OnKeyUp">OnKeyUp</a> callbacks to be called each time the key is pressed.</p>
  <p id="KeyOpt-s"><strong>S</strong>: Suppresses (blocks) the key after processing it. This overrides <a href="#VisibleText">VisibleText</a> or <a href="#VisibleNonText">VisibleNonText</a> until <code>-S</code> is used. <code>+S</code> implies <code>-V</code>.</p>
  <p id="KeyOpt-v"><strong>V</strong>: Visible. Prevents the key from being suppressed (blocked). This overrides <a href="#VisibleText">VisibleText</a> or <a href="#VisibleNonText">VisibleNonText</a> until <code>-V</code> is used. <code>+V</code> implies <code>-S</code>.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p id="KeyOpt-remarks">Options can be set by both virtual key code and scan code, and are accumulative.</p>
<p>When a key is specified by name, the options are set either by VK or by SC. Where two physical keys share the same VK but differ by SC (such as <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>NumpadUp</kbd>), they are handled by SC. By contrast, if a VK number is used, it will apply to any physical key which produces that VK (and this may vary over time as it depends on the active keyboard layout).</p>
<p>Removing an option by VK number does not affect any options that were set by SC, or vice versa. However, when an option is removed by key name and that name is handled by VK, the option is also removed for the corresponding SC (according to the script's keyboard layout). This allows keys to be excluded by name after applying an option to <a href="#all-keys">all keys</a>.</p>
<p>If <code>+V</code> is set by VK and <code>+S</code> is set by SC (or vice versa), <code>+V</code> takes precedence.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">KeyName := InputHook.EndKey</pre>
<p>Note that EndKey returns the "normalized" name of the key regardless of how it was written in <em>EndKeys</em>. For example, <code>{Esc}</code> and <code>{vk1B}</code> both produce <code>Escape</code>. <a href="GetKeyName.htm">GetKeyName</a> can be used to retrieve the normalized name.</p>

<div class="methodShort" id="EndMods"><h3>EndMods</h3>
<p>Returns a string of the modifiers which were logically down when Input was terminated.</p>

<p>If all modifiers were logically down (pressed), the full string is:</p>
<pre>&lt;^&gt;^&lt;!&gt;!&lt;+&gt;+&lt;#&gt;#</pre>
<p>These modifiers have the same meaning as with <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a>. Each modifier is always qualified with &lt; (left) or &gt; (right). The corresponding key names are: LCtrl, RCtrl, LAlt, RAlt, LShift, RShift, LWin, RWin.</p>
<p><a href="InStr.htm">InStr</a> can be used to check whether a given modifier (such as <code>&gt;!</code> or <code>^</code>) is present. The following line can be used to convert <em>Mods</em> to a string of neutral modifiers, such as <code>^!+#</code>:</p>
<pre>Mods := RegExReplace(Mods, "[&lt;&gt;](.)(?:&gt;\1)?", "$1")</pre>
<p>Due to split-second timing, this property may be more reliable than <a href="GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a> even if it is used immediately after Input terminates, or in the <a href="#OnEnd">OnEnd</a> callback.</p>

<p>The function is passed the following parameters: <code>InputHook, Char</code>. <em>Char</em> is a string containing the character or characters.</p>
<p>The presence of multiple characters indicates that a dead key was used prior to the last keypress, but the two keys could not be transliterated to a single character.

<p>Key-up notifications must first be enabled by <a href="#KeyOpt">KeyOpt</a> or <a href="#NotifyNonText">NotifyNonText</a>. Whether a key is considered text or non-text is determined when the key is pressed. If an InputHook detects a key-up without having detected key-down, it is considered non-text.</p>
<p>The function is passed the following parameters: <code>InputHook, VK, SC</code>. <em>VK</em> and <em>SC</em> are integers. To retrieve the key name (if any), use <code>GetKeyName(Format("vk{:x}sc{:x}", VK, SC))</code>.</p>

<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">Integer (boolean)</a>. Default: true. Option <strong>B</strong> sets the value to false.</p>
<p>When <kbd>Backspace</kbd> acts as undo, it is treated as a text entry key. Specifically, whether the key is suppressed depends on <a href="#VisibleText">VisibleText</a> rather than <a href="#VisibleNonText">VisibleNonText</a>.</p>
<p><kbd>Backspace</kbd> is always ignored if pressed in combination with a modifier key such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (the logical modifier state is checked rather than the physical state).</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> If the input text is visible (such as in an editor) and the arrow keys or other means are used to navigate within it, <kbd>Backspace</kbd> will still remove the last character rather than the one behind the caret (insertion point).</p>

<pre class="Syntax">InputHook.FindAnywhere := Boolean</pre>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">Integer (boolean)</a>. Default: false. Option <strong>*</strong> sets the value to true.</p>
<p>If true, a match can be found anywhere within what the user types (the match can be a substring of the input text). If false, the entirety of what the user types must match one of the <em>MatchList</em> phrases. In both cases, one of the <em>MatchList</em> phrases must be typed in full.</p>

<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a>. Default: 0. Option <strong>I</strong> sets the value to 1 (or a given value).</p>
<p><em>Level</em> should be an integer between 0 and 101. Events which have a send level <em>lower</em> than this value are ignored. For example, a value of 101 causes all input generated by <a href="Send.htm">SendEvent</a> to be ignored, while a value of 1 only ignores input at the default send level (zero).</p>
<p>The <a href="Send.htm#SendInput">SendInput</a> and <a href="Send.htm#SendPlay">SendPlay</a> methods are always ignored, regardless of this setting. Input generated by any source other than AutoHotkey is never ignored as a result of this setting.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">InputHook.NotifyNonText := Boolean</pre>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">Integer (boolean)</a>. Default: false.</p>
<p>Setting this to true enables notifications for all keypresses which do not produce text, such as when pressing <kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>. Setting this property does not affect a key's <a href="#KeyOpt">options</a>, since the production of text depends on the active window's keyboard layout at the time the key is pressed. </p>
<p>NotifyNonText is applied to key-up events by considering whether a previous key-down with a matching VK code was classified as text or non-text. For example, if NotifyNonText is true, pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> will produce <a href="#OnKeyDown">OnKeyDown</a> and <a href="#OnKeyUp">OnKeyUp</a> calls for both <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>A</kbd>, while pressing <kbd>A</kbd> on its own will not call OnKeyDown or OnKeyUp unless <a href="#KeyOpt">KeyOpt</a> has been used to enable notifications for that key.</p>

<p>Dead keys are counted as producing text, although they do not typically produce an immediate effect. Pressing a dead key might also cause the following key to produce text (if only the dead key's character).</p>
<p><kbd>Backspace</kbd> is counted as producing text only when it <a href="#BackspaceIsUndo">acts as undo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The <a href="#Start">Start</a> method must be called before input will be collected.</p>
<p>InputHook is designed to allow different parts of the script to monitor input, with minimal conflicts. It can operate continuously, such as to watch for <a href="#ExSac">arbitrary words</a> or other patterns. It can also operate temporarily, such as to collect user input or temporarily override specific (or <a href="#ExKeyWaitAny">non-specific</a>) keys without interfering with hotkeys.</p>
<p>Keyboard <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> are still in effect while an Input is in progress, but cannot activate if any of the required modifier keys are suppressed, or if the hotkey uses the <em>reg</em> method and its suffix key is suppressed. For example, the hotkey <code>^+a::</code> <em>might</em> be overridden by InputHook, whereas the hotkey <code>$^+a::</code> would take priority unless the InputHook suppressed <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>.</p>
<p>Keys are either suppressed (blocked) or not depending on the following factors (in order):</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the <a href="#KeyOpt-v">V option</a> is in effect for this VK or SC, it is not suppressed.</li>
  <li>If the <a href="#KeyOpt-s">S option</a> is in effect for this VK or SC, it is suppressed.</li>
  <li>If the key is a <a href="../KeyList.htm#modifier">standard modifier key</a> or CapsLock, NumLock or ScrollLock, it is not suppressed.</li>
  <li><a href="#VisibleText">VisibleText</a> or <a href="#VisibleNonText">VisibleNonText</a> is consulted, depending on whether the key produces text. If the property is false, the key is suppressed.   See <a href="#VisibleText">VisibleText</a> for details about which keys are counted as producing text.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard hook</a> is required while an Input is in progress, but will be uninstalled automatically if it is no longer needed when the Input is terminated.</p>
<p>The script is <a href="../Scripts.htm#persistent">automatically persistent</a> while an Input is in progress, so it will continue monitoring input even if there are no running <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a>. The script may exit automatically when input ends (if there are no running threads and the script is not persistent for some other reason).</p>
<p>AutoHotkey does not support Input Method Editors (IME). The keyboard hook intercepts keyboard events and translates them to text by using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-tounicodeex">ToUnicodeEx</a> or ToAsciiEx (except in the case of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes#vk_packet">VK_PACKET</a> events, which encapsulate a single character).</p>
<p>If you use multiple languages or keyboard layouts, Input uses the keyboard layout of the active window rather than the script's (regardless of whether the Input is <a href="#vis">visible</a>).</p>
<p>Although not as flexible, <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a> are generally easier to use.</p>

<h2 id="comparison">InputHook vs. Input (v1)</h2>
<p>In AutoHotkey v1.1, InputHook is a replacement for the Input command, offering greater flexbility. The Input command was removed for v2.0, but the code below is mostly equivalent:</p>
<pre>
<em>; Input OutputVar, % Options, % EndKeys, % MatchList  ; v1</em>
ih := InputHook(Options, EndKeys, MatchList)
ih.Start()
ErrorLevel := ih.Wait()
if (ErrorLevel = "EndKey")
    ErrorLevel .= ":" ih.EndKey
OutputVar := ih.Input
</pre>
<p>The Input command terminates any previous Input which it started, whereas InputHook allows <a href="#stack">more than one Input</a> at a time.</p>
<p><em>Options</em> is interpreted the same, but the default settings differ:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Input command limits the length of the input to 16383, while InputHook limits it to 1023. This can be overridden with the <a href="#option-l">L option</a>, and there is no absolute maximum.</li>
  <li>The Input command blocks both text and non-text keystrokes by default, and blocks neither if the <a href="#vis">V option</a> is present. By contrast, InputHook blocks only text keystrokes by default (<a href="#VisibleNonText">VisibleNonText</a> defaults to true), so most hotkeys can be used while an Input is in progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Input command blocks the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> while it is in progress, whereas InputHook allows the thread to continue, or even exit (which allows any thread that it interrupted to resume). Instead of waiting, the script can register an <a href="#OnEnd">OnEnd</a> function to be called when the Input is terminated.</p>
<p>The Input command returns the user's input only after the Input is terminated, whereas InputHook's <a href="#Input">Input</a> property allows it to be retrieved at any time. The script can register an <a href="#OnChar">OnChar</a> function to be called whenever a character is added, instead of continuously checking the Input property.</p>
<p>InputHook gives much more control over individual keys via the <a href="#KeyOpt">KeyOpt</a> method. This includes adding or removing end keys, suppressing or not suppressing specific keys, or ignoring the text produced by specific keys.</p>
<p>Unlike the Input command, InputHook can be used to detect keys which do not produce text, <em>without</em> terminating the Input. This is done by registering an <a href="#OnKeyDown">OnKeyDown</a> function and using <a href="#KeyOpt">KeyOpt</a> or <a href="#NotifyNonText">NotifyNonText</a> to specify which keys are of interest.</p>
<p>If a <em>MatchList</em> item caused the Input to terminate, the <a href="#Match">Match</a> property can be consulted to determine exactly which match (this is more useful when the <a href="#asterisk">* option</a> is present).</p>
<p>Although the script can consult <a href="GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a> after the Input command returns, sometimes it does not accurately reflect which keys were pressed when the Input was terminated. InputHook's <a href="#EndMods">EndMods</a> property reflects the logical state of the modifier keys at the time Input was terminated.</p>
<p>There are some differences relating to backward-compatibility:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Input command stores end keys <kbd>A</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd> in uppercase even though other letters on some keyboard layouts are lowercase. Passing the value to <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> would produce a shifted keystroke instead of a plain one. By contrast, InputHook's <a href="#EndKeys">EndKeys</a> property always returns the normalized name; i.e. whichever character is produced by pressing the key without holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> or other modifiers.</li>
  <li><p>If a key name used in <em>EndKeys</em> corresponds to a VK which is shared between two physical keys (such as <kbd>NumpadUp</kbd> and <kbd>Up</kbd>), the Input command handles the primary key by VK and the secondary key by SC, whereas InputHook handles both by SC. <code>{vkNN}</code> notation can be used to handle the key by VK.</p>
  <p>When the end key is handled by VK, both physical keys can terminate the Input. For example, <code>{NumpadUp}</code> would cause the Input command to be terminated by pressing <kbd>Up</kbd>, but ErrorLevel would contain <code>EndKey:NumpadUp</code> since only the VK is considered.</p>
  <p>When an end key is handled by SC, the Input command always produces names for the known secondary SC of any given VK, and always produces <code>sc<i>NNN</i></code> for any other key (even if it has a name). By contrast, InputHook produces a name if the key has one.</p></li>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The keyboard hook monitors keystrokes for the purpose of activating <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a> and any keyboard <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> not supported by RegisterHotkey (which is a function built into the operating system). It also supports a few other features such as the <a href="InputHook.htm">InputHook</a> function.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey does not install the keyboard and mouse hooks unconditionally because together they consume at least 500 KB of memory. Therefore, the keyboard hook is normally installed only when the script contains one of the following: 1) <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a>; 2) one or more <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> that require the keyboard hook (most do not); 3) <a href="SetNumScrollCapsLockState.htm">SetCaps/Scroll/NumLock AlwaysOn/AlwaysOff</a>; 4) active <a href="InputHook.htm">Input hooks</a>.</p>
<p>By contrast, the InstallKeybdHook function can be used to unconditionally install the keyboard hook, which has benefits including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a> can be used to display the last 20 keystrokes (for debugging purposes).</li>
  <li>The physical state of the modifier keys can be tracked reliably, which removes the need for <a href="A_HotkeyModifierTimeout.htm">A_HotkeyModifierTimeout</a> and may improve the reliability with which <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> restores the modifier keys to their proper states after temporarily releasing them.</li>
  <li><a href="GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a> can retrieve the physical state of a key.</li>
  <li><a href="../Variables.htm#TimeIdleKeyboard">A_TimeIdleKeyboard</a> and <a href="../Variables.htm#TimeIdlePhysical">A_TimeIdlePhysical</a> can work correctly (ignoring mouse input or artificial input, respectively).</li>
  <li>Mouse hotkeys which use the Alt modifier (such as <code>!LButton::</code>) can suppress the window menu more efficiently, by sending only one <a href="A_MenuMaskKey.htm">menu mask key</a> when the Alt key is released, instead of sending one each time the button is clicked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keyboard hotkeys which do not require the hook will use the <em>reg</em> method even if the InstallKeybdHook function is used. By contrast, applying the <a href="_UseHook.htm">#UseHook</a> directive or the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#prefixdollar">$ prefix</a> to a keyboard hotkey forces it to require the hook, which causes the hook to be installed if the hotkey is enabled.</p>
<p>You can determine whether a script is using the hook via the <a href="KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a> function or menu item. You can determine which hotkeys are using the hook via the <a href="ListHotkeys.htm">ListHotkeys</a> function or menu item.</p>

    <p><code>"Off"</code> or <code>0</code> (<code>False</code>): The letters A-Z are considered identical to their lowercase counterparts.</p>
    <p><code>"Locale"</code>: The search is case insensitive according to the rules of the current user's locale. For example, most English and Western European locales treat not only the letters A-Z as identical to their lowercase counterparts, but also non-ASCII letters like &Auml; and &Uuml; as identical to theirs. <em>Locale</em> is 1 to 8 times slower than <em>Off</em> depending on the nature of the strings being compared.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>StartingPos</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>Omit <em>StartingPos</em> to search the entire string. Otherwise, specify the position at which to start the search, where 1 is the first character, 2 is the second character, and so on. Negative values count from the end of <em>Haystack</em>, so -1 is the last character, -2 is the second-last, and so on.</p>
    <p>If <em>Occurrence</em> is omitted, a negative <em>StartingPos</em> causes the search to be conducted from right to left. However, <em>StartingPos</em> has no effect on the direction of the search if <em>Occurrence</em> is specified.</p>
    <p>For a right-to-left search, <em>StartingPos</em> specifies the position of the <em>last</em> character of the first potential occurence of <em>Needle</em>. For example, <code>InStr("abc", "bc",, 2, +1)</code> will find a match but <code>InStr("abc", "bc",, 2, -1)</code> will not.</p>
    <p>If the absolute value of <em>StartingPos</em> is greater than the length of <em>Haystack</em>, 0 is returned.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Occurrence</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If <em>Occurrence</em> is omitted, it defaults to the first match of <em>Needle</em> in <em>Haystack</em>. The search is conducted from right to left if <em>StartingPos</em> is negative; otherwise it is conducted from left to right.</p>
    <p>If <em>Occurrence</em> is positive, the search is always conducted from left to right. Specify 2 for <em>Occurrence</em> to return the position of the second match, 3 for the third match, etc.</p>
    <p>If <em>Occurrence</em> is negative, the search is always conducted from right to left. For example, -2 searches for the second occurrence from the right.</p>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>This function returns the position of an occurrence of the string <em>Needle</em> in the string <em>Haystack</em>. Position 1 is the first character; this is because 0 is synonymous with "false", making it an intuitive "not found" indicator.</p>
<p>Regardless of the values of <em>StartingPos</em> or <em>Occurrence</em>, the return value is always relative to the first character of <em>Haystack</em>. For example, the position of "abc" in "123abc789" is always 4.</p>
<p>Conventionally, an occurrence of an empty string (<code>""</code>) can be found at any position. However, as a blank <em>Needle</em> would typically only by passed by mistake, it is treated as an error (an exception is thrown).</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#ValueError">ValueError</a> is thrown in any of the following cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Needle</em> is an empty (zero-length) string.</li>
  <li><em>CaseSense</em> is invalid.</li>
  <li><em>Occurrence</em> or <em>StartingPos</em> is 0 or non-numeric.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p><a href="RegExMatch.htm">RegExMatch</a> can be used to search for a pattern (regular expression) within a string, making it much more flexible than InStr. However, InStr is generally faster than RegExMatch when searching for a simple substring.</p>
<p>InStr searches only up to the first binary zero (null-terminator), whereas RegExMatch searches the entire <a href="StrLen.htm">length</a> of the string even if it includes binary zero.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Use IsSet to check a variable directly, as in <code>IsSet(MyGlobalVar)</code>.</p>
<p>Use IsSetRef to check a <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a>, which would typically be contained by a variable, as in the example below.</p>
<p>A variable which has not been assigned a value is also known as an <a href="../Concepts.htm#uninitialized-variables">uninitialized variable</a>. Attempting to read an uninitialized variable causes an exception to be thrown. IsSet can be used to avoid this, such as for initializing a global or static variable on first use.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="../Functions.htm#InitStatic">Static initializers</a> such as <code>static my_static_array := []</code> are evaluated only once, the first time they are reached during execution, so typically do not require the use of IsSet.</p>
<p>Although IsSet uses the same syntax as a function call, it may be considered more of an operator than a function. The keyword <em>IsSet</em> is reserved for the use shown here and cannot be redefined as a variable or function. IsSet cannot be called indirectly because any attempt to pass an uninitialized variable would cause an error to be thrown.</p>
<p>IsSetRef can also be used to check a specific variable, by using it with the <a href="../Variables.htm#ref">reference operator</a>. When using it this way, be aware of the need to <a href="../Functions.htm#Global">declare the variable</a> first if it is global. For example, the <code>&amp;</code> in <code>IsSetRef(&amp;MyVar)</code> would cause <em>MyVar</em> to resolve to a local variable by default, if used within an assume-local function which lacks the declaration <code>global MyVar</code>.</p>

<p>Displays script info and a history of the most recent keystrokes and mouse clicks.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">KeyHistory</span> <span class="optional">MaxEvents</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>MaxEvents</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>Omit this parameter to show the script's <a href="../Program.htm#main-window">main window</a>, equivalent to selecting the "View-&gt;Key history" menu item.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, this parameter sets the maximum number of keyboard and mouse events that can be recorded for display in the window (default 40, limit 500). The key history is also reset, but the main window is not shown or refreshed. Specify 0 to disable key history entirely.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>To disable key history, use the following:</p>
<pre>KeyHistory 0</pre>
<p>This feature is intended to help <a href="../Scripts.htm#debug">debug scripts and hotkeys</a>. It can also be used to detect the scan code of a non-standard keyboard key using the steps described at the bottom of the <a href="../KeyList.htm#SpecialKeys">key list</a> page (knowing the scan code allows such a key to be made into a hotkey).</p>
<p>The virtual key (VK) of the wheel events (WheelDown, WheelUp, WheelLeft, and WheelRight) are placeholder values that do not have any meaning outside of AutoHotkey. Also, the scan code for wheel events is actually the number of notches by which the wheel was turned (typically 1).</p>
<p>If the script does not have the <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard hook</a> installed, the KeyHistory window will display only the keyboard events generated by the script itself (i.e. not the user's).  If the script does not have the  <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse hook</a> installed, mouse button events will not be shown. You can find out if your script uses either hook via "View-&gt;Key History" in the script's main window (accessible via "Open" in the tray icon). You can force the hooks to be installed by adding either or both of the following lines to the script:</p>
<pre><a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">InstallKeybdHook</a>
<a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">InstallMouseHook</a></pre>
<p>Because each keystroke or mouse click consists of a down-event and an up-event, KeyHistory displays only half as many "complete events" as specified by <em>MaxEvents</em>. For example, if the script calls <code>KeyHistory 50</code>, up to 25 keystrokes and mouse clicks will be displayed.</p>

<h1>KeyWait</h1>

<p>Waits for a key or mouse/joystick button to be released or pressed down.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">KeyWait</span> KeyName <span class="optional">, Options</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>KeyName</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>This can be just about any single character from the keyboard or one of the key names from the <a href="../KeyList.htm">key list</a>, such as a mouse/joystick button. Joystick attributes other than buttons are not supported.</p>
      <p>An explicit virtual key code such as <code>vkFF</code> may also be specified. This is useful in the rare case where a key has no name and produces no visible character when pressed. Its virtual key code can be determined by following the steps at the bottom of the <a href="../KeyList.htm#SpecialKeys">key list page</a>.</p></dd>

  <dt>Options</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>If this parameter is blank, the function will wait indefinitely for the specified key or mouse/joystick button to be physically released by the user. However, if the <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard hook</a> is not installed and <em>KeyName</em> is a keyboard key released artificially by means such as the <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> function, the key will be seen as having been physically released. The same is true for mouse buttons when the <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse hook</a> is not installed.</p>
      <p>Options: A string of one or more of the following letters (in any order, with optional spaces in between):</p>
      <p><strong>D</strong>: Wait for the key to be pushed down.</p>
      <p><strong>L</strong>: Check the logical state of the key, which is the state that the OS and the active window believe the key to be in (not necessarily the same as the physical state). This option is ignored for joystick buttons.</p>
      <p><strong>T</strong>: Timeout (e.g. <code>T3</code>). The number of seconds to wait before timing out and returning 0. If the key or button achieves the specified state, the function will not wait for the timeout to expire. Instead, it will immediately return 1.</p>
      <p>The timeout value can be a floating point number such as 2.5, but it should not be a hexadecimal value such as 0x03.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">Integer (boolean)</a></p>
<p>This function returns 0 (false) if the function timed out or 1 (true) otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The physical state of a key or mouse button will usually be the same as the logical state unless the keyboard and/or mouse hooks are installed, in which case it will accurately reflect whether or not the user is physically holding down the key. You can determine if your script is using the hooks via the <a href="KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a> function or menu item. You can force either or both of the hooks to be installed by adding the <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">InstallKeybdHook</a> and <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">InstallMouseHook</a> functions to the script.</p>
<p>While the function is in a waiting state, new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> can be launched via <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a>.</p>
<p>To wait for two or more keys to be released, use KeyWait consecutively. For example:</p>
<pre>KeyWait "Control"  <em>; Wait for both Control and Alt to be released.</em>
KeyWait "Alt"</pre>
<p>To wait for any one key among a set of keys to be pressed down, see the examples section of the <a href="InputHook.htm">InputHook</a> function.</p>

<h2 id="Intro">Introduction and Simple Example</h2>
<p>A List-View is one of the most elaborate controls provided by the operating system. In its most recognizable form, it displays a tabular view of rows and columns, the most common example of which is Explorer's list of files and folders (detail view).</p>
<p>A ListView usually looks like this:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_listview.png" alt="ListView" />
<p>Though it may be elaborate, a ListView's basic features are easy to use. The syntax for creating a ListView is:</p>
<pre class="Syntax" id="GuiAdd">LV := GuiObj.<span class="func">Add</span>("ListView", Options, ["ColumnTitle1","ColumnTitle2","..."])</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre class="Syntax">LV := GuiObj.<span class="func">AddListView</span>(Options, ["ColumnTitle1","ColumnTitle2","..."])</pre>
<p>Here is a working script that creates and displays a ListView containing a list of files in the user's "My Documents" folder:</p>
<pre><em>; Create the window:</em>
MyGui := Gui()

<em>; Create the ListView with two columns, Name and Size:</em>
LV := MyGui.Add("ListView", "r20 w700", ["Name","Size (KB)"])

<em>; Notify the script whenever the user double clicks a row:</em>
LV.OnEvent("DoubleClick", LV_DoubleClick)

<em>; Gather a list of file names from a folder and put them into the ListView:</em>
Loop Files, A_MyDocuments "\*.*"
    <a href="#Add">LV.Add</a>(, A_LoopFileName, A_LoopFileSizeKB)

<a href="#ModifyCol">LV.ModifyCol</a>  <em>; Auto-size each column to fit its contents.</em>
LV.ModifyCol(2, "Integer")  <em>; For sorting purposes, indicate that column 2 is an integer.</em>

<em>; Display the window:</em>
MyGui.Show

LV_DoubleClick(LV, RowNumber)
{
    RowText := <a href="#GetText">LV.GetText</a>(RowNumber)  <em>; Get the text from the row's first field.</em>
    ToolTip("You double-clicked row number " RowNumber ". Text: '" RowText "'")
}</pre>
<h2 id="Options">Options and Styles for the Options Parameter</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Specify the word Background followed immediately by a color name (see <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">color chart</a>) or RGB value (the 0x prefix is optional). Examples: <code>BackgroundSilver</code>, <code>BackgroundFFDD99</code>. If this option is not present, the ListView initially defaults to the system's default background color. Specifying <code>BackgroundDefault</code> or <code>-Background</code> applies the system's default background color (usually white). For example, a ListView can be restored to the default color via <code>LV.Opt("+BackgroundDefault")</code>.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Text color. Specify the letter C followed immediately by a color name (see <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">color chart</a>) or RGB value (the 0x prefix is optional). Examples: <code>cRed</code>, <code>cFF2211</code>, <code>c0xFF2211</code>, <code>cDefault</code>.</p>
<p id="Checked"><strong>Checked:</strong> Provides a checkbox at the left side of each row. When <a href="#Add">adding</a> a row, specify the word <em>Check</em> in its options to have the box to start off checked instead of unchecked. The user may either click the checkbox or press the spacebar to check or uncheck a row.</p>
<p id="Count"><strong>Count:</strong> Specify the word Count followed immediately by the total number of rows that the ListView will ultimately contain. This is not a limit: rows beyond the count can still be added. Instead, this option serves as a hint to the control that allows it to allocate memory only once rather than each time a row is added, which greatly improves row-adding performance (it may also improve sorting performance). To improve performance even more, use <code>LV.Opt("-Redraw")</code> prior to adding a large number of rows and <code>LV.Opt("+Redraw")</code> afterward. See <a href="GuiControl.htm#redraw-remarks">Redraw</a> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Grid:</strong> Provides horizontal and vertical lines to visually indicate the boundaries between rows and columns.</p>
<p><strong>Hdr:</strong> Specify <code>-Hdr</code> (minus Hdr) to omit the header (the special top row that contains column titles). To make it visible later, use <code>LV.Opt("+Hdr")</code>.</p>
<p id="LVS_EX"><strong>LV:</strong> Specify the string LV followed immediately by the number of an <a href="../misc/Styles.htm#LVS_EX">extended ListView style</a>. These styles are entirely separate from generic extended styles. For example, specifying <code><strong>-E</strong>0x200</code> would remove the generic extended style WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE to eliminate the control's default border. By contrast, specifying <code><strong>-LV</strong>0x20</code> would remove <a href="#frs">LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT</a>.</p>
<p><strong>LV0x10</strong>: Specify <code>-LV0x10</code> to prevent the user from dragging column headers to the left or right to reorder them. However, it is usually not necessary to do this because the physical reordering of columns does not affect the column order seen by the script. For example, the first column will always be column 1 from the script's point of view, even if the user has physically moved it to the right of other columns.</p>
<p id="frs"><strong>LV0x20</strong>: Specify <code>-LV0x20</code> to require that a row be clicked at its first field to select it (normally, a click on <em>any</em> field will select it). The advantage of this is that it makes it easier for the user to drag a rectangle around a group of rows to select them.</p>
<p><strong>Multi:</strong> Specify <code>-Multi</code> (minus Multi) to prevent the user from selecting more than one row at a time.</p>
<p><strong>NoSortHdr:</strong> Prevents the header from being clickable. It will take on a flat appearance rather than its normal button-like appearance. Unlike most other ListView styles, this one cannot be changed after the ListView is created.</p>
<p id="NoSort"><strong>NoSort:</strong> Turns off the automatic sorting that occurs when the user clicks a column header. However, the header will still behave visually like a button (unless NoSortHdr has been specified). In addition, the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#ColClick">ColClick</a> event is still raised, so the script can respond with a custom sort or other action.</p>
<p id="ReadOnly"><strong>ReadOnly:</strong>  Specify <code>-ReadOnly</code> (minus ReadOnly) to allow editing of the text in the first column of each row. To edit a row, select it then press <kbd>F2</kbd> (see the <a href="#WantF2">WantF2</a> option below). Alternatively, you can click a row once to select it, wait at least half a second, then click the same row again to edit it.</p>
<p><strong>R</strong>: Rows of height (upon creation). Specify the letter R followed immediately by the number of rows for which to make room inside the control. For example, <code>R10</code> would make the control 10 rows tall. If the ListView is created with a <a href="#View">view mode</a> other than report view, the control is sized to fit rows of icons instead of rows of text. Note: adding <a href="#IL">icons</a> to a ListView's rows will increase the height of each row, which will make this option inaccurate.</p>
<p id="Sort"><strong>Sort:</strong> The control is kept alphabetically sorted according to the contents of the first column.</p>
<p id="SortDesc"><strong>SortDesc:</strong> Same as above except in descending order.</p>
<p id="WantF2"><strong>WantF2</strong>: Specify <code>-WantF2</code> (minus WantF2) to prevent <kbd>F2</kbd> from <a href="#ReadOnly">editing</a> the currently focused row. This setting is ignored unless <code>-<a href="#ReadOnly">ReadOnly</a></code> is also in effect.</p>
<p><strong>(Unnamed numeric styles):</strong> Since styles other than the above are rarely used, they do not have names. See the <a href="../misc/Styles.htm#ListView">ListView styles table</a> for a list.</p>
<h2 id="View">View Modes</h2>
<p>A ListView has five viewing modes, of which the most common is report view (which is the default). To use one of the other views, specify its name in the options list. The view can also be changed after the control is created; for example: <code>LV.Opt("+IconSmall")</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Icon:</strong> Shows a large-icon view. In this view and all the others except <em>Report</em>, the text in columns other than the first is not visible. To display icons in this mode, the ListView must have a large-icon <a href="#IL">ImageList</a> assigned to it.</p>
<p><strong>Tile</strong>: Shows a large-icon view but with ergonomic differences such as displaying each item's text to the right of the icon rather than underneath it. <a href="#Checked">Checkboxes</a> do not function in this view.</p>
<p><strong>IconSmall:</strong> Shows a small-icon view.</p>
<p><strong>List:</strong> Shows a small-icon view in list format, which displays the icons in columns. The number of columns depends on the width of the control and the width of the widest text item in it.</p>
<p><strong>Report:</strong> Switches back to report view, which is the initial default. For example: <code>LV.Opt("+Report")</code>.</p>
<h2 id="BuiltIn">Built-in Methods for ListViews</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="GuiControl.htm">default methods/properties of a GUI control</a>, ListView controls have the following methods (defined in the Gui.ListView class).</p>
<p id="RowNumber">When the phrase "row number" is used on this page, it refers to a row's current position within the ListView. The top row is 1, the second row is 2, and so on. After a row is added, its row number tends to change due to sorting, deleting, and inserting of other rows. Therefore, to locate specific row(s) based on their contents, it is usually best to use the <a href="#GetText">GetText method</a> in a loop.</p>
<p><strong>Row methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Add">Add</a>: Adds a new row to the bottom of the list.</li>
  <li><a href="#Insert">Insert</a>: Inserts a new row at the specified row number.</li>
  <li><a href="#Modify">Modify</a>: Modifies the attributes and/or text of a row.</li>
  <li><a href="#Delete">Delete</a>: Deletes the specified row or all rows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Column methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#ModifyCol">ModifyCol</a>: Modifies the attributes and/or text of the specified column and its header.</li>
  <li><a href="#InsertCol">InsertCol</a>: Inserts a new column at the specified column number.</li>
  <li><a href="#DeleteCol">DeleteCol</a>: Deletes the specified column and all of the contents beneath it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Retrieval methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#GetCount">GetCount</a>: Returns the total number of rows or columns.</li>
  <li><a href="#GetNext">GetNext</a>: Returns the row number of the next selected, checked, or focused row.</li>
  <li><a href="#GetText">GetText</a>: Retrieves the text at the specified row and column.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#SetImageList">SetImageList</a>: Sets or replaces an ImageList for displaying icons.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="methodShort" id="Add">
    <h3>Add</h3>
    <p>Adds a new row to the bottom of the list, and returns the new <a href="#RowNumber">row number</a>, which is not necessarily the last row if the ListView has the <a href="#Sort">Sort</a> or <a href="#SortDesc">SortDesc</a> style.</p>
    <pre class="Syntax">NewRowNumber := LV.<span class="func">Add</span>(<span class="optional">Options, Col1, Col2, ...</span>)</pre>
    <dl>
      <dt id="RowOptions">Options</dt>
      <dd>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>A string containing zero or more words from the list below (not case sensitive). Separate each word from the next with a space or tab. To remove an option, precede it with a minus sign. To add an option, a plus sign is permitted but not required.</p>
<p><strong>Check</strong>: Shows a checkmark in the row (if the ListView has <a href="#Checked">checkboxes</a>). To later uncheck it, use <code>LV.Modify(RowNumber, "-Check")</code>.</p>
<p id="ColN"><strong>Col</strong>: Specify the word Col followed immediately by the column number at which to begin applying the parameters <em>Col1</em> and beyond. This is most commonly used with the <a href="#Modify">Modify method</a> to alter individual fields in a row without affecting those that lie to their left.</p>
<p id="Focus"><strong>Focus</strong>: Sets keyboard focus to the row (often used in conjunction with Select). To later de-focus it, use <code>LV.Modify(RowNumber, "-Focus")</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Icon</strong>: Specify the word Icon followed immediately by the number of this row's icon, which is displayed in the left side of the first column. If this option is absent, the first icon in the <a href="#IL">ImageList</a> is used. To display a blank icon, specify -1 or a number that is larger than the number of icons in the ImageList. If the control lacks a small-icon ImageList, no icon is displayed nor is any space reserved for one in <a href="#View">report view</a>.</p>
<p>This option accepts a one-based icon number, but this is internally translated to a zero-based index; therefore, <code>Icon0</code> corresponds to the constant <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/controls/list-view-controls-overview#callback-items-and-the-callback-mask">I_IMAGECALLBACK</a>, which is normally defined as -1, and <code>Icon-1</code> corresponds to I_IMAGENONE. Other out of range values may also cause a blank space where the icon would be.</p>
<p><strong>Select</strong>: Selects the row. To later deselect it, use <code>LV.Modify(RowNumber, "-Select")</code>. When selecting rows, it is usually best to ensure that at least one row always has the <a href="#Focus">focus property</a> because that allows the Apps key to display its <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#ContextMenu">context menu</a> (if any) near the focused row. The word <em>Select</em> may optionally be followed immediately by a 0 or 1 to indicate the starting state. In other words, both <code>"Select"</code> and <code>"Select" <strong>.</strong> VarContainingOne</code> are the same (the period used here is the <a href="../Variables.htm#concat">concatenation operator</a>). This technique also works with <em>Focus</em> and <em>Check</em> above.</p>
<p id="Vis"><strong>Vis</strong>: Ensures that the specified row is completely visible by scrolling the ListView, if necessary. This has an effect only for LV.Modify; for example: <code>LV.Modify(RowNumber, "Vis")</code>.</p>

      <dt>Col1, Col2, ...</dt>

    <hr>
    <p><strong><em>General options:</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>N</strong>: Specify for N the new width of the column, in pixels. This number can be unquoted if is the only option. For example, the following are both valid: <code>LV.ModifyCol(1, 50)</code> and <code>LV.ModifyCol(1, "50 Integer")</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Auto</strong>: Adjusts the column's width to fit its contents. This has no effect when not in Report (Details) view.</p>
    <p><strong>AutoHdr</strong>: Adjusts the column's width to fit its contents and the column's header text, whichever is wider. If applied to the last column, it will be made at least as wide as all the remaining space in the ListView. It is usually best to apply this setting only after the rows have been added because that allows any newly-arrived vertical scroll bar to be taken into account when sizing the last column. This option has no effect when not in Report (Details) view.</p>
    <p><strong>Icon</strong>: Specify the word Icon followed immediately by the number of the <a href="#IL">ImageList's</a> icon to display next to the column header's text. Specify <code>-Icon</code> (minus icon) to remove any existing icon.</p>
    <p><strong>IconRight</strong>: Puts the icon on the right side of the column rather than the left.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong><em>Data type options:</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Float</strong>: For sorting purposes, indicates that this column contains floating point numbers (hexadecimal format is not supported). Sorting performance for Float and Text columns is up to 25 times slower than it is for integers.</p>
    <p id="Integer"><strong>Integer</strong>: For sorting purposes, indicates that this column contains integers. To be sorted properly, each integer must be 32-bit; that is, within the range -2147483648 to 2147483647. If any of the values are not integers, they will be considered zero when sorting (unless they start with a number, in which case that number is used). Numbers may appear in either decimal or hexadecimal format (e.g. <code>0xF9E0</code>).</p>
    <p id="Text"><strong>Text</strong>: Changes the column back to text-mode sorting, which is the initial default for every column. Only the first 8190 characters of text are significant for sorting purposes (except for the <a href="#Logical"><em>Logical</em> option</a>, in which case the limit is 4094).</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong><em>Alignment options:</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Center</strong>: Centers the text in the column. To center an Integer or Float column, specify the word Center after the word Integer or Float.</p>
    <p><strong>Left</strong>: Left-aligns the column's text, which is the initial default for every column. On older operating systems, the first column might have a forced left-alignment.</p>
    <p><strong>Right</strong>: Right-aligns the column's text. This attribute need not be specified for Integer and Float columns because they are right-aligned by default. That default can be overridden by specifying something such as <code>"Integer Left"</code> or <code>"Float Center"</code>.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><strong><em>Sorting options:</em></strong></p>
    <p id="Case"><strong>Case</strong>: The sorting of the column is case sensitive (affects only <a href="#Text">text</a> columns). If the options <em>Case</em>, <em>CaseLocale</em>, and <em>Logical</em> are all omitted, the uppercase letters A-Z are considered identical to their lowercase counterparts for the purpose of the sort.</p>
    <p><strong>CaseLocale</strong>: The sorting of the column is case insensitive based on the current user's locale (affects only <a href="#Text">text</a> columns). For example, most English and Western European locales treat the letters A-Z and ANSI letters like &Auml; and &Uuml; as identical to their lowercase counterparts. This method also uses a "word sort", which treats hyphens and apostrophes in such a way that words like "coop" and "co-op" stay together.</p>
    <p id="Desc"><strong>Desc</strong>: Descending order. The column starts off in descending order the first time the user sorts it.</p>
    <p id="Logical"><strong>Logical</strong>: Same as <em>CaseLocale</em> except that any sequences of digits in the text are treated as true numbers rather than mere characters. For example, the string "T33" would be considered greater than "T4". <em>Logical</em> and <em>Case</em> are currently mutually exclusive: only the one most recently specified will be in effect.</p>
    <p><strong>NoSort</strong>: Prevents a user's click on this column from having any automatic sorting effect. However, the <a href="GuiOnEvent.htm#ColClick">ColClick</a> event is still raised, so the script can respond with a custom sort or other action. To disable sorting for all columns rather than only a subset, include <a href="#NoSort">NoSort</a> in the ListView's options.</p>
    <p><strong>Sort</strong>: Immediately sorts the column in ascending order (even if it has the <a href="#Desc">Desc</a> option).</p>
    <p><strong>SortDesc</strong>: Immediately sorts the column in descending order.</p>
    <p><strong>Uni</strong>: Unidirectional sort. This prevents a second click on the same column from reversing the sort direction.</p>

<p>This method is normally called prior to adding any rows to the ListView.</p>
    <p>A ListView may have up to two ImageLists: small-icon and/or large-icon. This is useful when the script allows the user to switch to and from the large-icon view. To add more than one ImageList to a ListView, call the SetImageList method a second time, specifying the ImageListID of the second list. A ListView with both a large-icon and small-icon ImageList should ensure that both lists contain the icons in the same order. This is because the same ID number is used to reference both the large and small versions of a particular icon.</p>
<p>Although it is traditional for all <a href="#View">viewing modes</a> except Icon and Tile to show small icons, this can be overridden by passing a large-icon list to the SetImageList method and specifying 1 (small-icon) for the second parameter. This also increases the height of each row in the ListView to fit the large icon.</p>
    <p>
      Any such detached ImageList should normally be destroyed via <a href="ListView.htm#IL_Destroy">IL_Destroy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="IL">ImageLists</h2>
<p>An Image-List is a group of identically sized icons stored in memory. Upon creation, each ImageList is empty. The script calls IL_Add repeatedly to add icons to the list, and each icon is assigned a sequential number starting at 1. This is the number to which the script refers to display a particular icon in a row or column header. Here is a working example that demonstrates how to put icons into a ListView's rows:</p>
<pre>MyGui := Gui()  <em>; Create a MyGui window.</em>
LV := MyGui.Add("ListView", "h200 w180", ["Icon &amp; Number","Description"])  <em>; Create a ListView.</em>
ImageListID := <a href="#IL_Create">IL_Create</a>(10)  <em>; Create an ImageList to hold 10 small icons.</em>
LV.<a href="#SetImageList">SetImageList</a>(ImageListID)  <em>; Assign the above ImageList to the current ListView.</em>
Loop 10  <em>; Load the ImageList with a series of icons from the DLL.</em>
    <a href="#IL_Add">IL_Add</a>(ImageListID, "shell32.dll", A_Index) 
Loop 10  <em>; Add rows to the ListView (for demonstration purposes, one for each icon).</em>
    LV.Add("Icon" . A_Index, A_Index, "n/a")
LV.ModifyCol("Hdr")  <em>; Auto-adjust the column widths.</em>
MyGui.Show</pre>
<h3 id="IL_Create">IL_Create</h3>

If <em>IconNumber</em> is negative, its absolute value is assumed to be the resource ID of an icon within an executable file.

      <p>Non-icon images such as BMP, GIF and JPG may also be loaded.

      <p>Supported image formats include ANI, BMP, CUR, EMF, Exif, GIF, ICO, JPG, PNG, TIF, and WMF.</p>

    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    Note: It is normally not necessary to destroy ImageLists because once attached to a ListView, they are destroyed automatically when the ListView or its parent window is destroyed. However, if the ListView shares ImageLists with other ListViews (by having <code>0x40</code> in its options), the script should explicitly destroy the ImageList after destroying all the ListViews that use it. Similarly, if the script replaces one of a ListView's old ImageLists with a new one, it should explicitly destroy the old one.</p>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p><a href="Gui.htm#Submit">Gui.Submit</a> has no effect on a ListView control.</p>
<p>After a column is sorted -- either by means of the user clicking its header or the script calling <code>LV.<a href="#ModifyCol">ModifyCol</a>(1, "Sort")</code> -- any subsequently added rows will appear at the bottom of the list rather than obeying the sort order. The exception to this is the <a href="#Sort">Sort</a> and <a href="#SortDesc">SortDesc</a> styles, which move newly added rows into the correct positions.</p>
<p id="Enter">To detect when the user has pressed <kbd>Enter</kbd> while a ListView has focus, use a <a href="GuiControls.htm#DefaultButton">default button</a> (which can be hidden if desired). For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Button", "Hidden Default", "OK").OnEvent("Click", LV_Enter)
...
LV_Enter(*) {
    global
    if MyGui.FocusedCtrl != LV
        return
    MsgBox("Enter was pressed. The focused row number is " LV.GetNext(0, "Focused"))
}</pre>
<p>In addition to navigating from row to row with the keyboard, the user may also perform incremental search by typing the first few characters of an item in the first column. This causes the selection to jump to the nearest matching row.</p>
<p>Although any length of text can be stored in each field of a ListView, only the first 260 characters are displayed.</p>
<p>Although the maximum number of rows in a ListView is limited only by available system memory, row-adding performance can be greatly improved as described in the <a href="#Count">Count</a> option.</p>
<p>A picture may be used as a background around a ListView (that is, to frame the ListView). To do this, create the <a href="GuiControls.htm#Picture">picture control</a> after the ListView and include <code>0x4000000</code> (which is WS_CLIPSIBLINGS) in the picture's <em>Options</em>.</p>
<p>A script may create more than one ListView per window.</p>
<p>It is best not to insert or delete columns directly with <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>. This is because the program maintains a collection of <a href="#Integer">sorting preferences</a> for each column, which would then get out of sync. Instead, use the <a href="#BuiltIn">built-in column methods</a>.</p>
<p>To perform actions such as resizing, hiding, or changing the font of a ListView, see <a href="GuiControl.htm">GuiControl object</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="Error.htm#TargetError">TargetError</a> is thrown if the window or control could not be found.</p>
<p>An <a href="Error.htm#OSError">OSError</a> is thrown if a message could not be sent to the control, or if the process owning the ListView could not be opened, perhaps due to a lack of user permissions or because it is locked.</p>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#ValueError">ValueError</a> is thrown if the <a href="#ColN">Col<em>N</em> option</a> specifies a nonexistent column.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Some applications store their ListView text privately, which prevents their text from being retrieved. In these cases, an exception will usually not be thrown, but all the retrieved fields will be empty.</p>
<p>The columns in a ListView can be resized via <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> as shown in this example:</p>
<pre>SendMessage(0x101E, 0, 80, "SysListView321", WinTitle)  <em>; 0x101E is the message LVM_SETCOLUMNWIDTH.</em></pre>
<p>In the above, 0 indicates the first column (specify 1 for the second, 2 for the third, etc.) Also, 80 is the new width. Replace 80 with -1 to autosize the column. Replace it with -2 to do the same but also take into account the header text width.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Filename</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The filename of the picture, which is usually assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified. If the name of a DLL or EXE file is given without a path, it may be loaded from the directory of the current executable (AutoHotkey.exe or a compiled script) or a system directory.</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Options</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>A string of zero or more of the following options, with each separated from the last by a space or tab:</p>
    <p><strong>W</strong><em>n</em> and <strong>H</strong><em>n</em>: The width and height to load the image at, where <em>n</em> is an integer. If one dimension is omitted or -1, it is calculated automatically based on the other dimension, preserving aspect ratio. If both are omitted, the image's original size is used. If either dimension is 0, the original size is used for that dimension. For example: <code>"w80 h50"</code>, <code>"w48 h-1"</code> or <code>"w48"</code> (preserve aspect ratio), <code>"h0 w100"</code> (use original height but override width).</p>
    <p><strong>Icon</strong><em>n</em>: Indicates which icon to load from a file with multiple icons (generally an EXE or DLL file). For example, <code>"Icon2"</code> loads the file's second icon. Any supported image format can be converted to an icon by specifying <code>"Icon1"</code>. However, the icon is converted back to a bitmap if the <em>ImageType</em> parameter is omitted.</p>
    <p><strong>GDI+</strong>: Use GDI+ to load the image, if available. For example, <code>"GDI+ w100"</code>.</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>&amp;ImageType</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a></p>
    <p>A reference to a output variable in which to store a number indicating the type of handle being returned: 0 (IMAGE_BITMAP), 1 (IMAGE_ICON) or 2 (IMAGE_CURSOR).</p>
    <p>If this parameter is omitted, the return value is always a bitmap handle (icons/cursors are converted if necessary). This is because reliably using or deleting an icon/cursor/bitmap handle requires knowing which type it is.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>LoadPicture also supports <a href="../misc/ImageHandles.htm">the handle syntax</a>, such as for creating a resized image based on an icon or bitmap which has already been loaded into memory, or converting an icon to a bitmap by omitting <em>ImageType</em>.</p>
<p>If the image needs to be freed from memory, call whichever function is appropriate for the type of handle.</p>

<h1>Loop (normal)</h1>

<p>Performs a series of functions repeatedly: either the specified number of times or until <a href="Break.htm">break</a> is encountered.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Loop</span> <span class="optional">Count</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Count</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>How many times (iterations) to perform the loop. If omitted, the Loop continues indefinitely until a <a href="Break.htm">break</a> or <a href="Return.htm">return</a> is encountered. However, an explicit blank value or number less than 1 causes the loop to be skipped entirely.</p>
    <p><em>Count</em> is evaluated only once, right before the loop begins. For instance, if <em>Count</em> is an expression with side-effects such as function calls or assignments, the side-effects occur only once.</p>
    <p>If <em>Count</em> is enclosed in parentheses, a space or tab is not required. For example: <code>Loop(2)</code></p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The loop statement is usually followed by a <a href="Block.htm">block</a>, which is a collection of statements that form the <em>body</em> of the loop. However, a loop with only a single statement does not require a block (an "if" and its "else" count as a single statement for this purpose).</p>
<p>A common use of this statement is an infinite loop that uses the <a href="Break.htm">break</a> statement somewhere in the loop's <em>body</em> to determine when to stop the loop.</p>
<p>The use of <a href="Break.htm">break</a> and <a href="Continue.htm">continue</a> inside a loop are encouraged as alternatives to <a href="Goto.htm">goto</a>, since they generally make a script more understandable and maintainable. One can also create a "While" or "Do...While/Until" loop by making the first or last statement of the loop's <em>body</em> an IF statement that conditionally issues the <a href="Break.htm">break</a> statement, but the use of <a href="While.htm">While</a> or <a href="Until.htm">Loop...Until</a> is usually preferred.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_Index</strong> contains the number of the current loop iteration. It contains 1 the first time the loop's <em>body</em> is executed. For the second time, it contains 2; and so on. If an inner loop is enclosed by an outer loop, the inner loop takes precedence. A_Index works inside all types of loops, including <a href="LoopFiles.htm">file-loops</a> and <a href="LoopReg.htm">registry-loops</a>; but A_Index contains 0 outside of a loop.</p>
<p>A_Index can be assigned any integer value by the script. If <em>Count</em> is specified, changing A_Index affects the number of iterations that will be performed. For example, <code>A_Index := 3</code> would make the loop statement act as though it is on the third iteration (A_Index will be 4 on the next iteration), while <code>A_Index--</code> would prevent the current iteration from being counted toward the total.</p>
<p>The loop may optionally be followed by an <a href="Else.htm">Else</a> statement, which is executed if <em>Count</em> is zero.</p>
<p>The <a href="Block.htm#otb">One True Brace (OTB) style</a> may optionally be used. For example:</p>
<pre>Loop {
    ...
}
Loop RepeatCount {
    ...
}</pre>
<p>Specialized loops: Loops can be used to automatically retrieve files, folders, or registry items (one at a time). See <a href="LoopFiles.htm">file-loop</a> and <a href="LoopReg.htm">registry-loop</a> for details. In addition, <a href="LoopRead.htm">file-reading loops</a> can operate on the entire contents of a file, one line at a time. Finally, <a href="LoopParse.htm">parsing loops</a> can operate on the individual fields contained inside a delimited string.</p>

<p>All matching files are retrieved, including hidden files. By contrast, OS features such as the DIR command omit hidden files by default. To avoid processing hidden, system, and/or read-only files, use something like the following inside the loop:</p>
<pre>if A_LoopFileAttrib ~= "[HRS]"  <em>; Skip any file that is either H (Hidden), R (Read-only), or S (System). See <a href="../Variables.htm#regex">~= operator</a>.</em>
    continue  <em>; Skip this file and move on to the next one.</em></pre>
<p>To retrieve files' relative paths instead of absolute paths during a recursive search, use <a href="SetWorkingDir.htm">SetWorkingDir</a> to change to the base folder prior to the loop, and then omit the path from the Loop (e.g. <code>Loop Files, "*.*", "R"</code>). That will cause <a href="#LoopFilePath">A_LoopFilePath</a> to contain the file's path relative to the base folder.</p>
<p>A file-loop can disrupt itself if it creates or renames files or folders within its own purview. For example, if it renames files via <a href="FileMove.htm">FileMove</a> or other means, each such file might be found twice: once as its old name and again as its new name. To work around this, rename the files only after creating a list of them. For example:</p>
<pre>FileList := ""
Loop Files, "*.jpg"
    FileList .= A_LoopFileName "`n"
Loop Parse, FileList, "`n"
    FileMove A_LoopField, "renamed_" A_LoopField</pre>
<p>Files in an NTFS file system are probably always retrieved in alphabetical order. Files in other file systems are retrieved in no particular order. To ensure a particular ordering, use the <a href="Sort.htm">Sort</a> function as shown in the Examples section below.</p>
<p>File patterns longer than 259 characters are supported only when at least one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The system has <a href="../misc/LongPaths.htm">long path support</a> enabled (requires Windows 10 version 1607 or later).</li>
  <li>The <code>\\?\</code> <a href="../misc/LongPaths.htm#prefix">long path prefix</a> is used (caveats apply).</li>
</ul>
<p>In all other cases, file patterns longer than 259 characters will not find any files or folders. This limit applies both to <em>FilePattern</em> and any temporary pattern used during recursion into a subfolder.</p>
<p id="otb">The One True Brace (OTB) style may optionally be used, which allows the open-brace to appear on the same line rather than underneath. For example: <code>Loop Files "*.txt", "R" {</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a> for information about <a href="Block.htm">Blocks</a>, <a href="Break.htm">Break</a>, <a href="Continue.htm">Continue</a>, and the A_Index variable (which exists in every type of loop).</p>
<p>The loop may optionally be followed by an <a href="Else.htm">Else</a> statement, which is executed if no matching files or directories were found (i.e. the loop had zero iterations).</p>
<p>The functions <a href="FileGetAttrib.htm">FileGetAttrib</a>, <a href="FileGetSize.htm">FileGetSize</a>, <a href="FileGetTime.htm">FileGetTime</a>, <a href="FileGetVersion.htm">FileGetVersion</a>, <a href="FileSetAttrib.htm">FileSetAttrib</a>, and <a href="FileSetTime.htm">FileSetTime</a> can be used in a file-loop without their Filename/FilePattern parameter.</p>

    <p>The string to analyze.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Delimiters</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>If this parameter is blank or omitted, each character of the input string will be treated as a separate substring.</p>
      <p id="CSV">If this parameter is <code>"CSV"</code>, the string will be parsed in standard comma separated value format. Here is an example of a CSV line produced by MS Excel:</p>
<pre class="no-highlight">"first field",SecondField,"the word ""special"" is quoted literally",,"last field, has literal comma"</pre>
      <p>Otherwise, <em>Delimiters</em> contains one or more  characters (case sensitive), each of which is used to determine where the boundaries between substrings occur.</p>
      <p>Delimiter characters are not considered to be part of the substrings themselves. In addition, if there is nothing between a pair of delimiters within the input string, the corresponding substring will be empty.</p>
      <p>For example: <code>','</code> (a comma) would divide the string based on every occurrence of a comma. Similarly, <code>A_Tab A_Space</code> would start a new substring every time a space or tab is encountered in the input string.</p>
      <p>To use a string as a delimiter rather than a character, first use <a href="StrReplace.htm">StrReplace</a> to replace all occurrences of the string with a single character that is never used literally in the text, e.g. one of these special characters: &cent;&curren;&yen;&brvbar;&sect;&copy;&ordf;&laquo;&reg;&micro;&para;. Consider this example, which uses the string &lt;br&gt; as a delimiter:</p>
      <pre>NewHTML := StrReplace(HTMLString, "&lt;br&gt;", "&cent;")
Loop Parse, NewHTML, "&cent;" <em>; Parse the string based on the cent symbol.</em>
{
...
}</pre>
  </dd>

  <dt>OmitChars</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>An optional list of characters (case sensitive) to exclude from the beginning and end of each substring. For example, if <em>OmitChars</em> is <code>A_Space A_Tab</code>, spaces and tabs will be removed from the beginning and end (but not the middle) of every retrieved substring.</p>
    <p>If <em>Delimiters</em> is blank, <em>OmitChars</em> indicates which characters should be excluded from consideration (the loop will not see them).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A string parsing loop is useful when you want to operate on each field contained in a string, one at a time. Parsing loops use less memory than <a href="StrSplit.htm">StrSplit</a> (though either way the memory use is temporary) and in most cases they are easier to use.</p>
<p id="LoopField">The built-in variable <strong>A_LoopField</strong> exists within any parsing loop. It contains the contents of the current substring (field). If an inner parsing loop is enclosed by an outer parsing loop, the innermost loop's field will take precedence.</p>
<p>Although there is no built-in variable "A_LoopDelimiter", the example at the very bottom of this page demonstrates how to detect which delimiter was encountered for each field.</p>
<p>There is no restriction on the size of the input string or its fields.</p>
<p>To arrange the fields in a different order prior to parsing, use the <a href="Sort.htm">Sort</a> function.</p>
<p>See <a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a> for information about <a href="Block.htm">Blocks</a>, <a href="Break.htm">Break</a>, <a href="Continue.htm">Continue</a>, and the A_Index variable (which exists in every type of loop).</p>
<p>The loop may optionally be followed by an <a href="Else.htm">Else</a> statement, which is executed if the loop had zero iterations. Note that the loop always has at least one iteration unless <em>String</em> is empty or <em>Delimiters</em> is omitted and all characters in <em>String</em> are included in <em>OmitChars</em>.</p>

  <dt>InputFile</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The name of the text file whose contents will be read by the loop, which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified. The file's lines may end in carriage return and linefeed (`r`n), just linefeed (`n), or just carriage return (`r).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="OutputFile">OutputFile</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>The name of the file to be kept open for the duration of the loop, which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
      <p>Within the loop's body, use the <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> function without the <em>Filename</em> parameter (i.e. omit it) to append to this special file. Appending to a file in this manner performs better than using <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> in its 2-parameter mode because the file does not need to be closed and re-opened for each operation. Remember to include a linefeed (`n) or carriage return and linefeed (`r`n) after the text, if desired.</p>
      <p>The file is not opened if nothing is ever written to it. This happens if the Loop performs zero iterations or if it never calls <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Options</strong>: The end of line (EOL) translation mode and output file encoding depend on which options are passed in the opening call to <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> (i.e. the first call which omits <em>Filename</em>). Subsequent calls ignore the <em>Options</em> parameter. EOL translation is not performed by default; that is, linefeed (`n) characters are written as-is unless the <code>"`n"</code> option is present.</p>
      <p><strong>Standard Output (stdout)</strong>: Specifying an asterisk (*) for <em>OutputFile</em> sends any text written by <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> to standard output (stdout). Such text can be redirected to a file, piped to another EXE, or captured by <a href="_ErrorStdOut.htm">fancy text editors</a>. However, text sent to stdout will not appear at the command prompt it was launched from. This can be worked around by 1) compiling the script with the <a href="../misc/Ahk2ExeDirectives.htm#ConsoleApp">Ahk2Exe ConsoleApp directive</a>, or 2) piping a script's output to another command or program. See <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A file-reading loop is useful when you want to operate on each line contained in a text file, one at a time. The file is kept open for the entire operation to avoid having to re-scan each time to find the next line.</p>
<p id="LoopReadLine">The built-in variable <strong>A_LoopReadLine</strong> exists within any file-reading loop. It contains the contents of the current line excluding the carriage return and linefeed (`r`n) that marks the end of the line. If an inner file-reading loop is enclosed by an outer file-reading loop, the innermost loop's file-line will take precedence.</p>
<p>Lines up to 65,534 characters long can be read. If the length of a line exceeds this, its remaining characters will be read during the next loop iteration.</p>
<p><a href="StrSplit.htm">StrSplit</a> or a <a href="LoopParse.htm">parsing loop</a> is often used inside a file-reading loop to parse the contents of each line retrieved from <em>InputFile</em>. For example, if <em>InputFile</em>'s lines are each a series of tab-delimited fields, those fields can individually retrieved as in this example:</p>
<pre>Loop read, "C:\Database Export.txt"
{
    Loop parse, A_LoopReadLine, A_Tab
    {
        MsgBox "Field number " A_Index " is " A_LoopField "."
    }
}</pre>
<p>To load an entire file into a variable, use <a href="FileRead.htm">FileRead</a> because it performs much better than a loop (especially for large files).</p>
<p>To have multiple files open simultaneously, use <a href="FileOpen.htm">FileOpen</a>.</p>
<p id="otb">The One True Brace (OTB) style may optionally be used, which allows the open-brace to appear on the same line rather than underneath. For example: <code>Loop Read InputFile, OutputFile {</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a> for information about <a href="Block.htm">Blocks</a>, <a href="Break.htm">Break</a>, <a href="Continue.htm">Continue</a>, and the A_Index variable (which exists in every type of loop).</p>
<p>To control how the file is decoded when no byte order mark is present, use <a href="FileEncoding.htm">FileEncoding</a>.</p>
<p>The loop may optionally be followed by an <a href="Else.htm">Else</a> statement, which is executed if the input file is empty or could not be found. If <em>OutputFile</em> was specified, the special mode of <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> described <a href="#OutputFile">above</a> may also be used within the <em>Else</em> statement's body. If there is no <em>Else</em>, an <a href="Error.htm#OSError">OSError</a> is thrown if the file could not be found.</p>

  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The full name of the registry key.</p>
    <p>This must start with HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_USERS, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, or HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (or the abbreviations for each of these, such as HKLM). To access a <a href="#remote">remote registry</a>, prepend the computer name and a backslash, as in this example: \\workstation01\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</p>
  </dd>

  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>If blank or omitted, only values are included and subkeys are not recursed into. Otherwise, specify one or more of the following letters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>K = Include keys.</li>
      <li>V = Include values. Values are also included if both K and V are omitted.</li>
      <li>R = Recurse into subkeys. If R is omitted, keys and values within subkeys of <em>KeyName</em> are not included.</li>

  </dd>


</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A registry-loop is useful when you want to operate on a collection registry values or subkeys, one at a time. The values and subkeys are retrieved in reverse order (bottom to top) so that <a href="RegDelete.htm">RegDelete</a> and <a href="RegDeleteKey.htm">RegDeleteKey</a> can be used inside the loop without disrupting the loop.</p>
<p id="vars">The following variables exist within any registry-loop. If an inner registry-loop is enclosed by an outer registry-loop, the innermost loop's registry item will take precedence:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr>
    <th abbr="Var">Variable</th>
    <th abbr="Descr">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A_LoopRegName</td>
    <td>Name of the currently retrieved item, which can be either a value name or the name of a subkey. Value names displayed by Windows RegEdit as "(Default)" will be retrieved if a value has been assigned to them, but A_LoopRegName will be blank for them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A_LoopRegType</td>
    <td>The type of the currently retrieved item, which is one of the following words: KEY (i.e. the currently retrieved item is a subkey not a value), REG_SZ, REG_EXPAND_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ, REG_DWORD, REG_QWORD, REG_BINARY, REG_LINK, REG_RESOURCE_LIST, REG_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR, REG_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_LIST, REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN (probably rare on most Windows hardware). It will be empty if the currently retrieved item is of an unknown type.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A_LoopRegKey</td>
    <td>The full name of the key which contains the current loop item. For remote registry access, this value will <strong>not</strong> include the computer name.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A_LoopRegTimeModified</td>
    <td>The time the current subkey or any of its values was last modified. Format <a href="FileSetTime.htm">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a>. This variable will be empty if the currently retrieved item is not a subkey (i.e. <em>A_LoopRegType</em> is not the word KEY).</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When used inside a registry-loop, the following functions can be used in a simplified way to indicate that the currently retrieved item should be operated upon:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr>
    <th style="min-width: 11em;">Syntax</th>
    <th abbr="Descr">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Value := <a href="RegRead.htm">RegRead</a>()</code></td>
    <td>Reads the current item. If the current item is a key, an exception is thrown.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code><a href="RegWrite.htm">RegWrite</a> Value</code><br><code><a href="RegWrite.htm">RegWrite</a></code></td>
    <td>Writes to the current item. If <em>Value</em> is omitted, the item will be made 0 or blank depending on its type. If the current item is a key, an exception is thrown and the registry is not modified.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code><a href="RegDelete.htm">RegDelete</a></code></td>
    <td>Deletes the current item if it is a value. If the current item is a key, its default value will be deleted instead.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code><a href="RegDeleteKey.htm">RegDeleteKey</a></code></td>
    <td>Deletes the current item if it is a key. If the current item is a value, the key which <em>contains</em> that value will be deleted, including all subkeys and values.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>RegCreateKey</code></td>
    <td>Targets a key as described above for RegDeleteKey. If the key is deleted during the loop, RegCreateKey can be used to recreate it. Otherwise, RegCreateKey merely verifies that the script has write access to the key.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p id="remote">When accessing a remote registry (via the <em>KeyName</em> parameter described above), the following notes apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The target machine must be running the Remote Registry service.</li>
  <li>Access to a remote registry may fail if the target computer is not in the same domain as yours or the local or remote username  lacks sufficient permissions (however, see below for possible workarounds).</li>
  <li>Depending on your username's domain, workgroup, and/or permissions, you may have to connect to a shared device, such as by mapping a drive, prior to attempting remote registry access. Making such a connection -- using a remote username and password that has permission to access or edit the registry -- may as a side-effect enable remote registry access.</li>
  <li>If you're already connected to the target computer as a different user (for example, a mapped drive via user Guest), you may have to terminate that connection to allow the remote registry feature to reconnect and re-authenticate you as your own currently logged-on username.</li>
</ul>
<p id="otb">The One True Brace (OTB) style may optionally be used, which allows the open-brace to appear on the same line rather than underneath. For example: <code>Loop Reg "HKLM\Software\AutoHotkey", "V" {</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a> for information about <a href="Block.htm">Blocks</a>, <a href="Break.htm">Break</a>, <a href="Continue.htm">Continue</a>, and the A_Index variable (which exists in every type of loop).</p>
<p>The loop may optionally be followed by an <a href="Else.htm">Else</a> statement, which is executed if no registry items of the specified type were found (i.e. the loop had zero iterations).</p>

<h1>Map Object</h1>
<pre class="NoIndent">class Map extends Object</pre>

<p>A <strong>Map</strong> object associates or <em>maps</em> one set of values, called <em>keys</em>, to another set of values. A key and the value it is mapped to are known as a key-value pair. A map can contain any number of key-value pairs, but each key must be unique.</p>
<p>A key may be any <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a>, <a href="../Objects.htm">object</a> reference or null-terminated <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a>. Comparison of string keys is case-sensitive, while objects are compared by reference/address. <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Float</a> keys are automatically converted to String.</p>
<p>The simplest use of a map is to retrieve or set a key-value pair via the implicit <a href="#__Item">__Item</a> property, by simply writing the key between brackets following the map object. For example:</p>
<pre>clrs := Map()
clrs["Red"] := "ff0000"
clrs["Green"] := "00ff00"
clrs["Blue"] := "0000ff"
for clr in Array("Blue", "Green")
    MsgBox clrs[clr]
</pre>
<p>"MapObj" is used below as a placeholder for any Map object, as "Map" is the class itself.</p>
<p>In addition to the methods and property inherited from <a href="Object.htm">Object</a>, Map objects have the following predefined methods and properties.</p>

<p>This property actually doesn't exist by default, but can be defined by the script. When the script queries a key which is not found, the map checks for this property before throwing an <a href="Error.htm#UnsetError">UnsetItemError</a>. It can be implemented by any of the normal means, including a <a href="Object.htm#DefineProp">dynamic property</a> or <a href="../Objects.htm#Meta_Functions">meta-function</a>, but determining which key was queried would require overriding <a href="#__Item">__Item</a> or <a href="#Get">Get</a> instead.</p>

    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a>, <a href="../Objects.htm">object</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>When retrieving a value, <em>Key</em> must be a unique value previously associated with another value. An <a href="Error.htm#UnsetError">UnsetItemError</a> is thrown if <em>Key</em> has no associated value within the map, unless a <a href="#Default">Default</a> property is defined, in which case its value is returned.</p>
    <p>When assigning a value, <em>Key</em> can be any value to associate with <em>Value</em>; in other words, the <em>key</em> used to later access <em>Value</em>. <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Float</a> keys are automatically converted to String.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>The property name __Item is typically omitted, as shown above, but is used when overriding the property.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>MenuItemName</dt><dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The text to display on the menu item, or the position&amp; of an existing item to modify. See <a href="#MenuItemName">MenuItemName</a>.</p></dd>
  <dt>Function-or-Submenu</dt><dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">Function Object</a> or <strong>Menu</strong></p>
    <p>A <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">function object</a> to call as a new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> when the menu item is selected, or a reference to a Menu object to use as a submenu.</p>
    <p>This parameter is required when creating a new item, but optional when updating the <em>Options</em> of an existing item.</p>
  <p id="CallbackParams">The function should accept the following parameters:</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><i>FunctionName</i>(ItemName, ItemPos, MyMenu)</pre>

    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
  <p>If not omitted, <em>Options</em> must be a space- or tab-delimited list of one or more of the following options:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th abbr="Descr">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>P<em>n</em></td>
  <td>Replace <em>n</em> with the menu item's <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread priority</a>, e.g. <code>P1</code>. If this option is omitted when adding a menu item, the priority will be 0, which is the standard default. If omitted when updating a menu item, the item's priority will not be changed. Use a decimal (not hexadecimal) number as the priority.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>+Radio</td>
  <td>If the item is checked, a bullet point is used instead of a check mark.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>+Right</td>
  <td>The item is right-justified within the menu bar. This only applies to <a href="Gui.htm#MenuBar">menu bars</a>, not popup menus or submenus.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>+Break</td>
  <td>The item begins a new column in a popup menu.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>+BarBreak</td>
  <td>As above, but with a dividing line between columns.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The plus sign (+) is optional and can be replaced with minus (-) to remove the option, as in <code>-Radio</code>. Options are not case sensitive.</p>
<p>To change an existing item's options without affecting its callback or submenu, simply omit the <em>Callback-or-Submenu</em> parameter.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a multipurpose method that adds a menu item, updates one with a new submenu or callback, or converts one from a normal item into a submenu (or vice versa). If <em>MenuItemName</em> does not yet exist, it will be added to the menu. Otherwise, <em>MenuItemName</em> is updated with the newly specified <em>Callback-or-Submenu</em> and/or <em>Options</em>.</p>
<p>To add a menu separator line, omit all three parameters.</p>
<p><em>Add</em> always adds new menu items at the bottom of the menu, but <a href="#Insert">Insert</a> can be used to insert an item before an existing custom menu item.</p>
</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="AddStandard">
<h3>AddStandard</h3>
<p>Adds the standard <a href="../Program.htm#tray-icon">tray menu items</a>.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">MyMenu.<span class="func">AddStandard</span>()</pre>
<p>This method can be used with the tray menu or any other menu.</p>
<p>The standard items are inserted after any existing items. Any standard items already in the menu are not duplicated, but any missing items are added. The table below shows the names and positions of the standard items after calling AddStandard on an empty menu:</p>
<style>

  border: 1px solid #cccccc;
  color: black;

.fake-menu td:first-child {
  text-align: left;

.fake-sep {
  border: 1px solid #d7d7d7;

</style>
<table class="fake-menu">

  <tr><td>&amp;Pause Script</td><td>9</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>E&amp;xit</td><td>10</td><td>3</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Compiled scripts include only the last three by default. <code>&amp;Open</code> is included only if <a href="../Variables.htm#AllowMainWindow">A_AllowMainWindow</a> is 1 when AddStandard is called (in that case, add 1 to the positions shown in the third column). If the tray menu contains standard items, <code>&amp;Open</code> is inserted or removed whenever <a href="../Variables.htm#AllowMainWindow">A_AllowMainWindow</a> is changed. For other menus, <code>&amp;Open</code> has no effect if <a href="../Variables.htm#AllowMainWindow">A_AllowMainWindow</a> is 0.</p>
<p>Each standard item has an internal menu item ID corresponding to the function it performs, but can otherwise be modified or deleted like any other menu item. AddStandard detects existing items by ID, not by name. If the <a href="#Add">Add</a> method is used to change the callback function associated with a standard menu item, it is assigned a new unique ID and is no longer considered to be a standard item.</p>
<p>Adding the <code>&amp;Open</code> item to the tray menu causes it to become the default item if there wasn't one already.</p>
</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="Check">
<h3>Check</h3>
<p>Adds a visible checkmark in the menu next to <em>MenuItemName</em> (if there isn't one already).</p>

<dl>
  <dt>MenuItemName</dt><dd>

    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The name or position of a menu item. See <a href="#MenuItemName">MenuItemName</a>.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>If <em>MenuItemName</em> is omitted, all items are deleted from the menu, leaving the menu empty. An empty menu still exists and thus any other menus that use it as a submenu will retain those submenus.</p>
<p>To delete a separator line, identify it by its position in the menu. For example, use <code>MyMenu.Delete("3&amp;")</code> if there are two items preceding the separator.</p>
<p>If the <em>default</em> menu item is deleted, the effect will be similar to having set <code>MyMenu.Default := ""</code>.</p>
</div>

<div class="methodShort" id="Disable">
<h3>Disable</h3>
<p>Changes <em>MenuItemName</em> to a gray color to indicate that the user cannot select it.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>ItemToInsertBefore</dt><dd>

    <p>The name of an existing item or a position&amp; between 1 and <a href="#Examples">the current number of custom items</a> plus 1 (following the same rules as <a href="#MenuItemName">MenuItemName</a>). Items can also be appended by omitting <em>ItemToInsertBefore</em>.</p></dd>
  <dt>NewItemName</dt><dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The text to display on the menu item. Unlike <a href="#Add">Add</a>, this cannot be a position.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>The remaining parameters behave as per the <a href="#Add">Add</a> method, except that <em>Insert</em> creates a new item even if <em>NewItemName</em> matches the name of an existing item.</p>

  <dt>NewName</dt><dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The new name. If empty or omitted, <em>MenuItemName</em> will be converted into a separator line.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>The menu item's current callback or submenu is unchanged.</p>
<p>A separator line can be converted to a normal item by specifying the position&amp; of the separator and a non-blank <em>NewName</em>, and then using the <em>Add</em> method to give the item a callback or submenu.</p>

    <p>The path of an icon or image file. For a list of supported formats, see <a href="GuiControls.htm#IconSupport">the Picture control</a>.</p>
  <p>A <a href="../misc/ImageHandles.htm">bitmap or icon handle</a> can be used instead of a filename. For example, <code>"HICON:" handle</code>.</p>

<p>Setting the default item makes that item's font bold (setting a default item in menus other than the tray menu is currently purely cosmetic). When the user double-clicks the tray icon, its default menu item is launched (even if the item is disabled). If there is no default, double-clicking has no effect.</p>
<p>The default item for the tray menu is initially <code>&amp;Open</code>, if present. Adding <code>&amp;Open</code> to the tray menu by calling <a href="#AddStandard">AddStandard</a> or changing <a href="../Variables.htm#AllowMainWindow">A_AllowMainWindow</a> also causes it to become the default item if there wasn't one already.</p>

<p>Returns a handle to a <a href="#Win32_Menus">Win32 menu</a> (a handle of type <code>HMENU</code>), constructing it if necessary.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">MyMenu.Handle</pre>
<p>The returned handle is valid only until the Win32 menu is destroyed, which typically occurs when the Menu object is freed. Once the menu is destroyed, the operating system may reassign the handle value to any menus subsequently created by the script or any other program.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="MenuItemName">MenuItemName</h2>
<p>The name or position of a menu item. Some common rules apply to this parameter across all methods which use it:</p>
<p>To underline one of the letters in a menu item's name, precede that letter with an ampersand (&amp;). When the menu is displayed, such an item can be selected by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard. To display a literal ampersand, specify two consecutive ampersands as in this example: <code>"Save &amp;&amp; Exit"</code></p>
<p>When referring to an existing menu item, the name is not case sensitive but any ampersands must be included. For example: <code>"&amp;Open"</code></p>
<p>The names of menu items can be up to 260 characters long.</p>
<p>To identify an existing item by its position in the menu, write the item's position followed by an ampersand. For example, <code>"1&amp;"</code> indicates the first item.</p>

<h2 id="Win32_Menus">Win32 Menus</h2>
<p>Windows provides a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/menurc/menus">set of functions and notifications</a> for creating, modifying and displaying menus with standard appearance and behavior. We refer to a menu created by one of these functions as a <em>Win32 menu</em>.</p>
<p>As items are added to a menu or modified, the name and other properties of each item are stored in the Menu object. A Win32 menu is constructed the first time the menu or its parent menu is attached to a GUI or shown. It is destroyed automatically when the menu object is deleted (which occurs when its reference count reaches zero).</p>
<p><a href="#Handle">Menu.Handle</a> returns a handle to a Win32 menu (a handle of type <code>HMENU</code>), constructing it if necessary.</p>
<p>Any modifications which are made to the menu directly by Win32 functions are not reflected by the script's Menu object, so may be lost if an item is modified by one of the built-in methods.</p>
<p>Each menu item is assigned an ID when it is first added to the menu. Scripts cannot rely on an item receiving a particular ID, but can retrieve the ID of an item by using GetMenuItemID as shown in <a href="#ExDllCall">example #5</a>. This ID cannot be used with the Menu object, but can be used with various <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/menurc/menus">Win32 functions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A menu usually looks like this:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_menu.png" alt="Menu" style="border: 1px solid silver;" />
<p>If a menu ever becomes completely empty -- such as by using <code>MyMenu.Delete()</code> -- it cannot be shown. If the tray menu becomes empty, right-clicking and double-clicking the tray icon will have no effect (in such cases it is usually better to use <a href="_NoTrayIcon.htm">#NoTrayIcon</a>).</p>
<p>If a menu item's callback is already running and the user selects the same menu item again, a new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> will be created to run that same callback, interrupting the previous thread. To instead buffer such events until later, use <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> as the callback's first line (however, this will also buffer/defer other threads such as the press of a hotkey).</p>
<p>Whenever a function is called via a menu item, it starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>. These defaults can be changed during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>.</p>
<p>When building a menu whose contents are not always the same, one approach is to point all such menu items to the same function and have that function refer to its <a href="#CallbackParams">parameters</a> to determine what action to take. Alternatively, a <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">function object</a>, <a href="../Functions.htm#closures">closure</a> or <a href="../Variables.htm#fat-arrow">fat arrow function</a> can be used to bind one or more values or variables to the menu item's callback function.</p>

    <p>The search is case-insensitive according to the rules of the current user's locale, and stops at the first matching item. The use of ampersand (&amp;) to indicate the underlined letter in a menu item is <em>usually</em> not necessary (i.e. &amp;File is the same as File).</p>

If the parameter does not contain an ampersand, all ampersands are ignored, including literal ones. For example, an item displayed as "a &amp; b" may match a parameter value of <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> or <code>a  b</code>.</p>

<p>A <a href="Error.htm#ValueError">ValueError</a> is thrown if a menu, submenu or menu item could not be found, or if the final menu parameter corresponds to a menu item which opens a submenu.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>For this function to work, the target window need not be active. However, some windows might need to be in a <a href="WinRestore.htm">non-minimized</a> state.</p>
<p>This function <strong>will not work</strong> with applications that use non-standard menu bars. Examples include Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express, which use disguised toolbars for their menu bars. In these cases, consider using <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a> or <a href="PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a>, which should be able to interact with some of these non-standard menu bars.</p>
<p>The menu name parameters can also specify positions. This method exists to support menus that don't contain text (perhaps because they contain pictures of text rather than actual text). Position 1&amp; is the first menu item (e.g. the File menu), position 2&amp; is the second menu item (e.g. the Edit menu), and so on. Menu separator lines count as menu items for the purpose of determining the position of a menu item.</p>
<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>

<h2 id="sys">System Menu</h2>
<p><em>Menu</em> can be <code>0&amp;</code> to select an item within the window's system menu, which typically appears when the user presses <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> or clicks on the icon in the window's title bar. For example:</p>
<pre><em>; Paste a command into cmd.exe without activating the window.</em>
A_Clipboard := "echo Hello, world!`r"
MenuSelect "ahk_exe cmd.exe",, "0&amp;", "Edit", "Paste"</pre>
<p class="warning"><strong>Caution:</strong> Use this only on windows which have custom items in their system menu.</p>
<p>If the window does not already have a custom system menu, a copy of the standard system menu will be created and assigned to the target window as a side effect. This copy is destroyed by the system when the script exits, leaving other scripts unable to access it. Therefore, avoid using 0&amp; for the standard items which appear on all windows. Instead, post the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/menurc/wm-syscommand">WM_SYSCOMMAND</a> message directly. For example:</p>
<pre><em>; Like [<a href="WinMinimize.htm">WinMinimize</a> "A"], but also play the system sound for minimizing.</em>
WM_SYSCOMMAND := 0x0112
SC_MINIMIZE := 0xF020

      <p><u>The button to click</u>: Left (default), Right, Middle (or just the first letter of each of these); or the fourth or fifth mouse button (X1 or X2). For example: <code>MouseClick "X1"</code>. This parameter may be omitted, in which case it defaults to Left.</p>
      <p>Left and Right correspond to the primary button and secondary button. If the user swaps the buttons via system settings, the physical positions of the buttons are swapped but the effect stays the same.</p>
      <p><u>Rotate the mouse wheel</u>: Specify WheelUp or WU to turn the wheel upward (away from you); specify WheelDown or WD to turn the wheel downward (toward you). Specify WheelLeft (or WL) or WheelRight (or WR) to push the wheel left or right, respectively. <em>ClickCount</em> is the number of notches to turn the wheel.</p>

    <p>The speed to move the mouse in the range 0 (fastest) to 100 (slowest).</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A speed of 0 will move the mouse instantly.</p>
    <p>If omitted, the default speed (as set by <a href="SetDefaultMouseSpeed.htm">SetDefaultMouseSpeed</a> or 2 otherwise) will be used.</p>
    <p><em>Speed</em> is ignored for <a href="SendMode.htm">SendInput/Play modes</a>; they move the mouse instantaneously (though <a href="SetMouseDelay.htm">SetMouseDelay</a> has a mode that applies to SendPlay). To visually move the mouse more slowly -- such as a script that performs a demonstration for an audience -- use <code><a href="Send.htm#Click">SendEvent</a> "{Click 100 200}"</code> or <code><a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> "Event"</code> (optionally in conjuction with <a href="BlockInput.htm">BlockInput</a>).</p>

    <p><strong>D:</strong> Press the mouse button down but do not release it (i.e. generate a down-event).</p>
    <p><strong>U:</strong> Release the mouse button (i.e. generate an up-event).</p>

    <p>If omitted, the X and Y coordinates will be treated as absolute values. To change this behavior, specify the following letter:</p>
    <p><strong>R:</strong> The X and Y coordinates will be treated as offsets from the current mouse position. In other words, the cursor will be moved from its current position by X pixels to the right (left if negative) and Y pixels down (up if negative).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This function uses the sending method set by <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Click.htm">Click function</a> is recommended over MouseClick because it is generally easier to use. However, MouseClick supports the <em>Speed</em> parameter, whereas adjusting the speed of movement by Click requires the use of <a href="SetDefaultMouseSpeed.htm">SetDefaultMouseSpeed</a>.</p>
<p>To perform a shift-click or control-click, use the <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> function before and after the operation as shown in these examples:</p>
<pre><em>; Example #1: </em>
Send "{Control down}"
MouseClick "left", 55, 233
Send "{Control up}"</pre>
<pre>
<em>; Example #2:</em>
Send "{Shift down}"
MouseClick "left", 55, 233
Send "{Shift up}"</pre>
<p>The <a href="SendMode.htm">SendPlay mode</a> is able to successfully generate mouse events in a broader variety of games than the other modes. In addition, some applications and games may have trouble tracking the mouse if it moves too quickly. The <em>speed</em> parameter or <a href="SetDefaultMouseSpeed.htm">SetDefaultMouseSpeed</a> can be used to reduce the speed (in the default <a href="SendMode.htm">SendEvent mode</a> only).</p>
<p>Some applications do not obey a <em>ClickCount</em> higher than 1 for the mouse wheel. For them, use a <a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a> such as the following:</p>
<pre>Loop 5
    MouseClick "WheelUp"</pre>
<p>The <a href="BlockInput.htm">BlockInput</a> function can be used to prevent any physical mouse activity by the user from disrupting the simulated mouse events produced by the mouse functions. However, this is generally not needed for the <a href="SendMode.htm">SendInput/Play</a> modes because they automatically postpone the user's physical mouse activity until afterward.</p>
<p>There is an automatic delay after every click-down and click-up of the mouse (except for <a href="SendMode.htm">SendInput mode</a> and for turning the mouse wheel). Use <a href="SetMouseDelay.htm">SetMouseDelay</a> to change the length of the delay.</p>

    <p>If omitted, the default speed (as set by <a href="SetDefaultMouseSpeed.htm">SetDefaultMouseSpeed</a> or 2 otherwise) will be used.</p>
    <p><em>Speed</em> is ignored for <a href="SendMode.htm">SendInput/Play modes</a>; they move the mouse instantaneously (though <a href="SetMouseDelay.htm">SetMouseDelay</a> has a mode that applies to SendPlay). To visually move the mouse more slowly -- such as a script that performs a demonstration for an audience -- use <code><a href="Send.htm#Click">SendEvent {Click 100 200}</a></code> or <code><a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> Event</code> (optionally in conjuction with <a href="BlockInput.htm">BlockInput</a>).</p>

    <p><strong>R:</strong> The X1 and Y1 coordinates will be treated as offsets from the current mouse position. In other words, the cursor will be moved from its current position by X1 pixels to the right (left if negative) and Y1 pixels down (up if negative). Similarly, the X2 and Y2 coordinates will be treated as offsets from the X1 and Y1 coordinates. For example, the following would first move the cursor down and to the right by 5 pixels from its starting position, and then drag it from that position down and to the right by 10 pixels: <code>MouseClickDrag "Left", 5, 5, 10, 10, , "R"</code>.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This function uses the sending method set by <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>.</p>
<p>Dragging can also be done via the various Send functions, which is more flexible because the mode can be specified via the function name. For example:</p>
<pre>SendEvent "{Click 6 52 Down}{click 45 52 Up}"</pre>
<p>Another advantage of the method above is that unlike MouseClickDrag, it automatically compensates when the user has swapped the left and right mouse buttons via the system's control panel.</p>
<p>The <a href="SendMode.htm">SendPlay mode</a> is able to successfully generate mouse events in a broader variety of games than the other modes. However, dragging via SendPlay might not work in RichEdit controls (and possibly others) such as those of WordPad and Metapad.</p>
<p>Some applications and games may have trouble tracking the mouse if it moves too quickly. The <em>speed</em> parameter or <a href="SetDefaultMouseSpeed.htm">SetDefaultMouseSpeed</a> can be used to reduce the speed (in the default <a href="SendMode.htm">SendEvent mode</a> only).</p>
<p>The <a href="BlockInput.htm">BlockInput</a> function can be used to prevent any physical mouse activity by the user from disrupting the simulated mouse events produced by the mouse functions. However, this is generally not needed for the <a href="SendMode.htm">SendInput/Play</a> modes because they automatically postpone the user's physical mouse activity until afterward.</p>
<p>There is an automatic delay after every click-down and click-up of the mouse (except for <a href="SendMode.htm">SendInput mode</a>). This delay also occurs after the movement of the mouse during the drag operation. Use <a href="SetMouseDelay.htm">SetMouseDelay</a> to change the length of the delay.</p>

    <p><strong>1</strong>: Uses a simpler method to determine <em>OutputVarControl</em>. This method correctly retrieves the active/topmost child window of an Multiple Document Interface (MDI) application such as SysEdit or TextPad. However, it is less accurate for other purposes such as detecting controls inside a GroupBox control.</p>
    <p><strong>2</strong>: Stores the <a href="ControlGetHwnd.htm">control's HWND</a> in <em>OutputVarControl</em> rather than the <a href="ControlGetClassNN.htm">control's ClassNN</a>.</p>
    <p>For example, to put both options into effect, the <em>Flag</em> parameter must be set to 3.</p>

<h2 id="Result">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>This function returns one of the following strings to represent which button the user pressed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OK</li>
  <li>Cancel</li>
  <li>Yes</li>
  <li>No</li>
  <li>Abort</li>
  <li>Retry</li>
  <li>Ignore</li>
  <li>TryAgain</li>
  <li>Continue</li>
  <li>Timeout (that is, the word "timeout" is returned if the message box timed out)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dialog could not be displayed, an empty string is returned. This typically only occurs as a result of the <a href="#max">MsgBox limit</a> being reached, but may occur in other unusual cases.</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>An <a href="Error.htm">Error</a> is thrown on failure, such as if the options are invalid, the <a href="#max">MsgBox limit</a> has been reached, or the message box could not be displayed for some other reason.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A message box usually looks like this:</p>
<img src="../static/dlg_message.png" alt="MsgBox" />
<p>To determine which button the user pressed, use the function's <a href="#Result">return value</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>Result := MsgBox("Would you like to continue? (press Yes or No)",, "YesNo")
if Result = "Yes"
    MsgBox "You pressed Yes."
else
    MsgBox "You pressed No."

if MsgBox("Retry or cancel?",, "R/C") = "Retry"
    MsgBox("You pressed Retry.")</pre>
<p>The names of the buttons can be customized by following <a href="../scripts/index.htm#MsgBoxButtonNames">this example</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> while a message box is active will copy its text to the clipboard. This applies to all message boxes, not just those produced by AutoHotkey.</p>
<p id="Owner"><strong>Using MsgBox with GUI windows</strong>: A GUI window may display a <em>modal</em> message box by means of the <a href="Gui.htm#OwnDialogs">OwnDialogs option</a>. A <em>modal</em> message box prevents the user from interacting with the GUI window until the message box is dismissed. In such a case, it is not necessary to specify the System Modal or Task Modal options from the table above.</p>
<p>When the <a href="Gui.htm#OwnDialogs">OwnDialogs option</a> is <em>not</em> in effect, the Task Modal option (8192) can be used to disable all the script's windows until the user dismisses the message box.</p>
<p>If the <code>Owner<i>HWND</i></code> option is specified, it takes precedence over any other setting. <i>HWND</i> can be the HWND of any window, even one not owned by the script.</p>
<p><strong>The Help button</strong>: When the Help button option (16384) is present in <em>Options</em>, pressing the Help button will have no effect unless both of the following are true:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The message box is owned by a GUI window by means of the <a href="Gui.htm#OwnDialogs">OwnDialogs option</a>.</li>
  <li>The script is monitoring the WM_HELP message (0x0053). For example: <code><a href="OnMessage.htm">OnMessage</a>(0x0053, "WM_HELP")</code>. When the WM_HELP function is called, it may guide the user by means such as showing another window or message box.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Close button (in the message box's title bar)</strong>: Since the message box is a built-in feature of the operating system, its <strong>X</strong> button is enabled only when certain buttons are present. If there is only an OK button, clicking the <strong>X</strong> button is the same as pressing OK. Otherwise, the X button is disabled unless there is a Cancel button, in which case clicking the <strong>X</strong> is the same as pressing Cancel.</p>
<p id="max"><strong>Maximum 7 ongoing calls</strong>: The <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> displaying a message box can typically be interrupted, allowing the new thread to display its own message box before the previous call returns. A maximum of 7 ongoing calls to MsgBox are permitted, but any calls beyond the 7th cause an <a href="Error.htm">Error</a> to be thrown. Note that a call to MsgBox in an interrupted thread cannot return until the thread is resumed.</p>

Therefore, to work with numbers greater than or equal to 0x8000000000000000, omit the U prefix and interpret any negative values as large integers. For example, a value of -1 as an Int64 is really 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF if it is intended to be a UInt64. On 64-bit builds, UPtr is equivalent to Int64.</p>

<h2 id="General_Remarks">General Remarks</h2>
<p>A sequence of numbers can be written by repeating <em>Type</em> and <em>Number</em> any number of times after the first <em>Number</em>.

<p>If an integer is too large to fit in the specified <em>Type</em>, its most significant bytes are ignored; e.g. <code>NumPut("Char", 257, buf)</code> would store the number 1.</p>

<h1>Object</h1>
<pre class="NoIndent">class Object extends Any</pre>

<p><strong>Object</strong> is the basic class from which other AutoHotkey object classes derive. Each instance of Object consists of a set of "own properties" and a base object, from which more properties are inherited. Objects also have methods, but these are just properties which can be called.</p>
<p>There are value properties and dynamic properties. Value properties simply contain a value. Dynamic properties do not contain a value, but instead call an <em>accessor function</em> depending on how they are accessed (get, set or call).</p>
<p>"Obj" is used below as a placeholder for any instance of the Object class.</p>
<p>All instances of Object are based on <code>Object.Prototype</code>, which is based on <code>Any.Prototype</code>. In addition to the methods and property inherited from <a href="Any.htm">Any</a>, Objects have the following predefined methods and properties.</p>

<p>This method can be used to convert a value property to a dynamic property or vice versa, but it is not possible to specify both a value and accessor functions.</p>

  <li>An inherited value property is equivalent to a set of accessor functions which return or call the value, or store a new value in <code>this</code>. Note that a new value would overwrite any dynamic property in <code>this</code> itself, and override any inherited accessor functions.</li>
  <li>If no <em>Set</em> or value is defined or inherited, attempting to set the property will throw an exception.</li>
  <li>If no <em>Call</em> is defined or inherited, <em>Get</em> may be called to retrieve a function object, which is then called.</li>
  <li>If no <em>Get</em> is defined or inherited but there is a <em>Call</em> accessor function, the function itself becomes the property's value (read-only).</li>
</ul>
<p>As with methods, the first parameter of <em>Get</em>, <em>Set</em> or <em>Call</em> is <code>this</code> (the target object). For <em>Set</em>, the second parameter is <code>value</code> (the value being assigned). These parameters are defined automatically by method and property definitions within a class, but must be defined explicitly if using normal functions. Any other parameters passed by the caller are appended to the parameter list.</p>
<p>The <code>MaxParams</code> and <code>IsVariadic</code> properties of the function objects are evaluated to determine whether the property may accept parameters. If <code>MaxParams</code> is 1 for <em>get</em> or 2 for <em>set</em> and <code>IsVariadic</code> is false or undefined, the property cannot accept parameters; they are instead forwarded to the <a href="../Objects.htm#__Item">__Item</a> property of the object returned by <em>get</em>.</p>

<p>For a dynamic property, the return value is a new object with an own property for each accessor function: <code>Get</code>, <code>Set</code>, <code>Call</code>. Each property is present only if the corresponding accessor function is defined in <em>Obj</em> itself. For a value property, the return value is a new object with a property named <code>Value</code>. In such cases, <code>Obj.GetOwnPropDesc(Name).Value == Obj.%Name%</code>.</p>
<p>Modifying the returned object has no effect on <em>Obj</em> unless <a href="#DefineProp">DefineProp</a> is called.</p>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#PropertyError">PropertyError</a> is thrown if <em>Obj</em> does not own a property by that name. The script can determine whether a property is dynamic by checking <code>not desc.HasProp("Value")</code>, where <em>desc</em> is the return value of GetOwnPropDesc.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">For Name <span class="optional">, Value</span> in Obj.<span class="func">OwnProps</span>()</pre>
<p>Returns a new <a href="Enumerator.htm">enumerator</a>. The enumerator is typically passed directly to a <a href="For.htm">for-loop</a>, which calls the enumerator once for each iteration of the loop. Each call to the enumerator returns the next property name and/or value. The for-loop's variables correspond to the enumerator's parameters, which are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Name</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The property's name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Value</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The property's value.</p>
    <p>If the property has a getter method, it is called to obtain the value (unless <em>Value</em> is omitted).</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>Dynamic properties are included in the enumeration. However:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since only the object's own properties are enumerated, the property must be defined directly in <em>Obj</em>.</li>
  <li>If only the first variable was specified, the property's name is returned and its getter is not called.</li>
  <li>If two variables were specified, the enumerator attempts to call the property's getter to retrieve the value.
    <ul>
      <li>If the getter requires parameters, the property is skipped.</li>
      <li>If <em>Obj</em> itself does not define a getter for this property, it is skipped.
        <p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Properties defined by a method definition typically do not have a getter, so are skipped.</p>
      </li>
      <li>If <em>Obj</em> is a class prototype object, the getter should not (and in some cases cannot) be called; so the property is skipped.</li>
      <li>If the getter throws an exception, it is propagated (not suppressed). The caller can continue enumeration at the next property only if it retained a reference to the enumerator (i.e. not if it passed the enumerator directly to a for-loop, since in that case the enumerator is freed when the for-loop aborts).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>To enumerate own properties without calling property getters, or to enumerate all properties regardless of type, pass only a single variable to the for-loop or enumerator. <a href="#GetOwnPropDesc">GetOwnPropDesc</a> can be used to differentiate value properties from dynamic properties, while also retrieving the value or getter/setter/method.</p>
<p>Methods are typically excluded from enumeration in the two-parameter mode, because evaluation of the property normally depends on whether the object has a corresponding getter or value, either in the same object or a base object. To avoid inconsistency when two variables are specified, OwnProps skips over own properties that have only a <em>Call</em> accessor function. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If OwnProps returned the method itself when no getter is defined, defining a getter would then prevent the method from being returned. Scripts relying on the two variable mode to retrieve methods would then miss some methods.</li>
  <li>If OwnProps returned the method itself when a getter is defined by a base object, this would be inconsistent with normal evaluation of the property.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default implementation of this method is also defined as a function: <code>ObjOwnProps(Obj)</code>.</p>

<p>The function can return a non-zero integer to prevent the script from exiting (with some <a href="#close">rare exceptions</a>) and subsequent functions from being called. Otherwise, the script exits after all registered functions are called.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Any number of OnExit functions can be registered. An OnExit function usually should not call ExitApp; if it does, the script terminates immediately.</p>
<p>OnExit functions are called when the script exits by any means (except when it is killed by something like "End Task"). It is also called whenever <a href="_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a> and <a href="Reload.htm">Reload</a> ask a previous instance to terminate.</p>
<p>A script can detect and optionally abort a system shutdown or logoff via <code>OnMessage(0x0011, On_WM_QUERYENDSESSION)</code> (see <a href="OnMessage.htm#ExShutdown">OnMessage example #2</a> for a working script).</p>
<p>The OnExit <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> does not obey <a href="_MaxThreads.htm">#MaxThreads</a> (it will always launch when needed). In addition, while it is running, it cannot be interrupted by any <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, including <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu items</a>, and <a href="SetTimer.htm">timed subroutines</a>. However, it will be interrupted (and the script will terminate) if the user chooses Exit from the tray menu or main menu, or the script is asked to terminate as a result of <a href="Reload.htm">Reload</a> or <a href="_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a>. Because of this, an OnExit function should be designed to finish quickly unless the user is aware of what it is doing.</p>
<p>If the OnExit <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> encounters a failure condition such as a runtime error, the script will terminate.</p>
<p>If the OnExit <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> was launched due to an <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> or <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> function that specified an exit code, that exit code is used unless an OnExit function returns true (preventing exit) or calls ExitApp.</p>
<p>Whenever an exit attempt is made, each OnExit function starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>. These defaults can be changed during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>.</p>

  <dt>MsgNumber</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The number of the message to monitor or query, which should be between 0 and 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF). If you do not wish to monitor a <a href="../misc/SendMessageList.htm">system message</a> (that is, one below 0x0400), it is best to choose a number greater than 4096 (0x1000) to the extent you have a choice. This reduces the chance of interfering with messages used internally by current and future versions of AutoHotkey.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Function</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">Function Object</a></p>
    <p>The function object to call when the message is received. The function's parameters and return value are described <a href="#The_Functions_Parameters">below</a>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="MaxThreads">MaxThreads</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>This integer is normally omitted, in which case the monitor function is limited to one <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> at a time. This is usually best because otherwise, the script would process messages out of chronological order whenever the monitor function interrupts itself. Therefore, as an alternative to <em>MaxThreads</em>, consider using <em>Critical</em> as described <a href="#Critical">below</a>.</p>
    <p>If the monitor function directly or indirectly causes the message to be sent again while the function is still running, it is necessary to specify a <em>MaxThreads</em> value greater than 1 or less than -1 to allow the monitor function to be called for the new message (if desired). Messages sent (not posted) by the script's own process to itself cannot be delayed or buffered.</p>
    <p>Specify 0 to unregister the previously registered function identified by <em>Function</em>.</p>
    <p>By default, when multiple functions are registered for a single <em>MsgNumber</em>, they are called in the order that they were registered. To register a function to be called before any previously registered functions, specify a negative value for <em>MaxThreads</em>. For example, <code>OnMessage Msg, Fn, -2</code> registers <code>Fn</code> to be called before any other functions previously registered for <em>Msg</em>, and allows <em>Fn</em> a maximum of 2 threads. However, if the function is already registered, the order will not change unless it is unregistered and then re-registered.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Any number of functions or <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">function objects</a> can monitor a given <em>MsgNumber</em>.</p>
<p>Either of these two lines registers a function object to be called <strong>after</strong> any previously registered functions:</p>
<pre>OnMessage MsgNumber, Function     <em>; Option 1 - omit MaxThreads</em>
OnMessage MsgNumber, Function, 1  <em>; Option 2 - specify MaxThreads 1</em></pre>
<p>This registers a function object to be called <strong>before</strong> any previously registered functions:</p>
<pre>OnMessage MsgNumber, Function, -1</pre>
<p>To unregister a function object, specify 0 for <em>MaxThreads</em>:</p>
<pre>OnMessage MsgNumber, Function, 0</pre>

<h2 id="The_Functions_Parameters">The Function's Parameters</h2>
<p>A <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a> assigned to monitor one or more messages should accept four parameters:</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><i>FunctionName</i>(wParam, lParam, msg, hwnd)</pre>
<p>Although the names you give the parameters do not matter, the following information is sequentially assigned to them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Parameter #1: The message's WPARAM value.</li>
  <li>Parameter #2: The message's LPARAM value.</li>
  <li>Parameter #3: The message number, which is useful in cases where a function monitors more than one message.</li>
  <li>Parameter #4: The HWND (unique ID) of the window or control to which the message was sent. The HWND can be used directly in a <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_id">WinTitle parameter</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>WPARAM and LPARAM are unsigned 32-bit integers (from 0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1) or signed 64-bit integers (from -2<sup>63</sup> to 2<sup>63</sup>-1) depending on whether the exe running the script is 32-bit or 64-bit. For 32-bit scripts, if an incoming parameter is intended to be a signed integer, any negative numbers can be revealed by following this example:</p>
<pre>if (A_PtrSize = 4 &amp;&amp; wParam &gt; 0x7FFFFFFF)  <em>; Checking <a href="../Variables.htm#PtrSize">A_PtrSize</a> ensures the script is 32-bit.</em>
    wParam := -(~wParam) - 1</pre>
<p>You can omit one or more parameters from the end of the list if the corresponding information is not needed, but in this case an asterisk must be specified as the final parameter. For example, a function defined as <code>MyMsgMonitor(wParam, lParam, *)</code> would receive only the first two parameters, and one defined as <code>MyMsgMonitor(*)</code> would receive none of them.</p>

<h2 id="Additional_Information_Available_to_the_Function">Additional Information Available to the Function</h2>
<p>In addition to the parameters received above, the function may also consult the built-in variable <a href="../Variables.htm#EventInfo">A_EventInfo</a>, which contains 0 if the message was sent via SendMessage. If sent via PostMessage, it contains the <a href="../Variables.htm#TickCount">tick-count time</a> the message was posted.</p>
<p>A monitor function's <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow">last found window</a> starts off as the parent window to which the message was sent (even if it was sent to a control). If the window is hidden but not a GUI window (such as the script's main window), turn on <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> before using it. For example:</p>
<pre>DetectHiddenWindows True
MsgParentWindow := WinExist()  <em>; This stores the unique ID of the window to which the message was sent.</em></pre>

<h2 id="What_the_Function_Should_Return">What the Function Should <em>Return</em></h2>
<p>If a monitor function uses <a href="Return.htm">Return</a> without any parameters, or it specifies a blank value such as "" (or it never uses Return at all), the incoming message goes on to be processed normally when the function finishes. The same thing happens if the function <a href="Exit.htm">Exits</a> or causes a runtime error such as <a href="Run.htm">running</a> a nonexistent file. By contrast, returning an integer causes it to be sent immediately as a reply; that is, the program does not process the message any further. For example, a function monitoring WM_LBUTTONDOWN (0x0201) may return an integer to prevent the target window from being notified that a mouse click has occurred. In many cases (such as a message arriving via <a href="PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a>), it does not matter which integer is returned; but if in doubt, 0 is usually safest.</p>
<p>The range of valid return values depends on whether the exe running the script is 32-bit or 64-bit. Non-empty return values must be between -2<sup>31</sup> and 2<sup>32</sup>-1 for 32-bit scripts (<code><a href="../Variables.htm#PtrSize">A_PtrSize</a> = 4</code>) and between -2<sup>63</sup> and 2<sup>63</sup>-1 for 64-bit scripts (<code><a href="../Variables.htm#PtrSize">A_PtrSize</a> = 8</code>).</p>
<p>If there are multiple functions monitoring a given message number, they are called one by one until one returns a non-empty value.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">General Remarks</h2>
<p>Unlike a normal function-call, the arrival of a monitored message calls the function as a new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>. Because of this, the function starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> and <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a>. These defaults can be changed during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>.</p>
<p>Messages sent to a control (rather than being posted) are not monitored because the system routes them directly to the control behind the scenes. This is seldom an issue for system-generated messages because most of them are posted.</p>
<p>If the script is intended to stay running in an idle state to monitor for incoming messages, it may be necessary to call the <a href="Persistent.htm">Persistent</a> function to prevent the script from exiting. OnMessage does not automatically make the script persistent, as it is sometimes unnecessary or undesired. For instance, when OnMessage is used to monitor input to a GUI window (such as in the <a href="#ExLButtonDown">WM_LBUTTONDOWN example</a>), it is often more appropriate to allow the script to exit automatically when the last GUI window is closed.</p>
<p id="Critical">If a message arrives while its function is still running due to a previous arrival of the same message, by default the function will not be called again; instead, the message will be treated as unmonitored. If this is undesirable, there are multiple ways it can be avoided:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the message is posted rather than sent and has a number greater than 0x0311, it can be buffered until its function completes by specifying <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> as the first line of the function. Alternatively, <a href="Thread.htm">Thread Interrupt</a> can achieve the same effect as long as it lasts long enough for the function to finish.</li>
  <li>Using <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> to increase the <a href="Critical.htm#Interval">message check interval</a> gives the function more time to complete before any messages are dispatched. An interval greater than 16 may be needed for reliability. Due to the granularity of the system timer (usually 15.6 milliseconds), the default interval for non-Critical threads (5 milliseconds) might appear to pass the instant after the function starts.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that the monitor function returns quickly reduces the risk that messages will be missed due to <em>MaxThreads</em>. One way to do this is to have it queue up a future thread by <a href="PostMessage.htm">posting</a> to its own script a monitored message number greater than 0x0311. That message's function should use <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> as its first line to ensure that its messages are buffered. Alternatively, a <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a> can be used to queue up a future thread.</li>
  <li>Specifying a higher value for the <a href="#MaxThreads">MaxThreads</a> parameter allows the function to be interrupted to process the newly-received message.</li>
</ul>
<p id="buffering">If a monitored message that is numerically greater than 0x0311 is posted while the script is <a href="../misc/Threads.htm#Interrupt">uninterruptible</a>, the message is buffered; that is, its function is not called until the script becomes interruptible. However, messages which are sent rather than posted cannot be buffered as they must provide a return value. Posted messages also might not be buffered when a modal message loop is running, such as for a system dialog, ListView drag-drop operation or menu.</p>
<p>If a monitored message arrives and is not buffered, its function is called immediately even if the thread is <a href="../misc/Threads.htm#Interrupt">uninterruptible</a> when the message is received.</p>
<p>The <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">priority</a> of OnMessage threads is always 0. Consequently, no messages are monitored or buffered when the current thread's priority is higher than 0.</p>
<p>Caution should be used when monitoring system messages (those below 0x0400). For example, if a monitor function does not finish quickly, the response to the message might take longer than the system expects, which might cause side-effects. Unwanted behavior may also occur if a monitor function returns an integer to suppress further processing of a message, but the system expected different processing or a different response.</p>
<p>When the script is displaying a system dialog such as <a href="MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a>, any message posted to a control is not monitored. For example, if the script is displaying a message box and the user clicks a button in a GUI window, the WM_LBUTTONDOWN message is sent directly to the button without calling the monitor function.</p>
<p>Although an external program may post messages directly to a script's thread via PostThreadMessage() or other API call, this is not recommended because the messages would be lost if the script is displaying a system window such as a <a href="MsgBox.htm">message box</a>. Instead, it is usually best to post or send the messages to the script's main window or one of its GUI windows.</p>

    <p>If omitted, the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> is paused. Otherwise, specify one of the following values:</p>
    <p><code>1</code> or <code>True</code>: Marks the thread beneath the current thread as paused so that when it resumes, it will finish the function it was running (if any) and then enter a paused state. If there is no thread beneath the current thread, the script itself is paused, which prevents <a href="SetTimer.htm">timers</a> from running (this effect is the same as having used the menu item "Pause Script" while the script has no threads).</p>
    <p><code>0</code> or <code>False</code>: Unpauses the underlying thread.</p>
    <p><code>-1</code>: Toggles the pause state of the underlying thread.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p><a href="../Variables.htm#IsPaused">A_IsPaused</a> contains the pause state of the underlying thread.</p>
<p>By default, the script can also be paused via its <a href="../Program.htm#tray-icon">tray icon</a> or <a href="../Program.htm#main-window">main window</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="Suspend.htm">Suspend</a> -- which disables <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> and <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a> -- turning on pause will freeze the thread (the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> if <em>NewState</em> was omitted, otherwise the underlying thread). As a side-effect, any interrupted threads beneath it will lie dormant.</p>
<p>Whenever any thread is paused, <a href="SetTimer.htm">timers</a> will not run. By contrast, explicitly launched threads such as <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> and <a href="Menu.htm">menu items</a> can still be launched; but when their <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> finish, the underlying thread will still be paused. In other words, each thread can be paused independently of the others.</p>
<p>With the default icons, the color of the tray icon changes from green to red whenever the script's <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> is in a paused state. This color change can be avoided by freezing the icon, which is achieved by specifying 1 for the last parameter of TraySetIcon. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="TraySetIcon.htm">TraySetIcon</a> ,, 1</pre>
<p>To disable <a href="SetTimer.htm">timers</a> without pausing the script, use <a href="Thread.htm">Thread "NoTimers"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>If the script is <em>persistent</em>, it will stay running after <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">startup</a> completes and all other <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> have exited. It is usually unnecessary to call this function because the script is <a href="../Scripts.htm#persistent">automatically persistent</a> in most of the common cases where the user would want it to keep running, such as to respond to <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a>, execute <a href="SetTimer.htm">timers</a> or display a <a href="Gui.htm">GUI</a>.</p>
<p>Some cases where this function might be needed (if it is intended to stay running when there are no running threads or hotkeys, timers, etc.) include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scripts which use <a href="OnMessage.htm">OnMessage</a> or <a href="CallbackCreate.htm">CallbackCreate</a> and <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> to respond to events, since those functions don't make the script persistent.</li>
  <li>Scripts that are executed by selecting a custom tray menu item.</li>
  <li>Scripts which <a href="ComObject.htm">create</a> or <a href="ComObjActive.htm">retrieve</a> COM objects and use <a href="ComObjConnect.htm">ComObjConnect</a> to respond to the object's events.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this function is added to an existing script, some or all occurrences of <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> might need to be changed to <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a>. This is because <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> will not terminate a persistent script; it  terminates only the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>X, Y</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The X and Y coordinates of the pixel. Coordinates are relative to the active window's client area unless <a href="CoordMode.htm">CoordMode</a> was used to change that.</p>

  <dt>Mode</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>This parameter may contain zero or more of the following words. If more than one word is present, separate each from the next with a space (e.g. <code>"Alt Slow"</code>).</p>
      <p><strong>Alt</strong>: Uses an alternate method to retrieve the color, which should be used when the normal method produces invalid or inaccurate colors for a particular type of window. This method is about 10% slower than the normal method.</p>
      <p><strong>Slow</strong>: Uses a more elaborate method to retrieve the color, which may work in certain full-screen applications when the other methods fail. This method is about three times slower than the normal method. Note: <em>Slow</em> takes precedence over <em>Alt</em>, so there is no need to specify <em>Alt</em> in this case.</p>
    </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>This function returns a hexadecimal numeric string representing the RGB (red-green-blue) color of the pixel. For example, the color purple is defined 0x800080 because it has an intensity of 0x80 (128) for its blue and red components but an intensity of 0x00 (0) for its green component.</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>An <a href="Error.htm#OSError">OSError</a> is thrown on failure.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The pixel must be visible; in other words, it is not possible to retrieve the pixel color of a window hidden behind another window. By contrast, pixels beneath the mouse cursor can usually be detected. The exception to this is game cursors, which in most cases will hide any pixels beneath them.</p>
<p>Use Window Spy (available in tray icon menu) or the example at the bottom of this page to determine the colors currently on the screen.</p>
<p>Known limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A window that is <a href="WinSetTransparent.htm">partially transparent</a> or that has one of its colors marked invisible (<a href="WinSetTransColor.htm">WinSetTransColor</a>) typically yields colors for the window behind itself rather than its own.</li>
  <li>PixelGetColor might not produce accurate results for certain applications. If this occurs, try specifying the word <em>Alt</em> or <em>Slow</em> in the last parameter.</li>

  <dt>ColorID</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The color ID to search for. This is typically expressed as a hexadecimal number in red-green-blue (RGB) format. For example: <code>0x9d6346</code>. Color IDs can be determined using Window Spy (accessible from the tray menu) or via <a href="PixelGetColor.htm">PixelGetColor</a>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Variation</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>A number between 0 and 255 (inclusive) to indicate the allowed number of shades of variation in either direction for the intensity of the red, green, and blue components of the color. For example, if 2 is specified and <var>ColorID</var> is 0x444444, any color from 0x424242 to 0x464646 will be considered a match. This parameter is helpful if the color sought is not always exactly the same shade. If you specify 255 shades of variation, all colors will match. The default is 0 shades.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The region to be searched must be visible; in other words, it is not possible to  search a region of a window hidden behind another window. By contrast, pixels beneath the mouse cursor can usually be detected. The exception to this is cursors in games, which in most cases will hide any pixels beneath them.</p>
<p>Although color depths as low as 8-bit (256-color) are supported, the fast mode performs much better in 24-bit or 32-bit color.</p>
<p>The search starts at the coordinates specified by <em>X1</em> and <em>Y1</em> and checks all pixels in the row from <em>X1</em> to <em>X2</em> for a match. If no match is found there, the search continues toward <em>Y2</em>, row by row, until it finds a matching pixel.</p>
<p>The search order depends on the order of the parameters. In other words, if <em>X1</em> is greater than <em>X2</em>, the search will be conducted from right to left, starting at column <em>X1</em>. Similarly, if <em>Y1</em> is greater than <em>Y2</em>, the search will be conducted from bottom to top.</p>
<p>If the region to be searched is large and the search is repeated with high frequency, it may consume a lot of CPU time. To alleviate this, keep the size of the area to a minimum.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>, PostMessage usually only sends basic numeric values, not pointers to structures or strings.</p>
<p>To send a message to all windows in the system, including those that are hidden or disabled, specify <code>0xFFFF</code> for <em>WinTitle</em> (0xFFFF is HWND_BROADCAST). This technique should be used only for messages intended to be broadcast.</p>
<p>To have a script receive a message, use <a href="OnMessage.htm">OnMessage</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../misc/SendMessage.htm">Message Tutorial</a> for an introduction to using this function.</p>
<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>

<h1>Random</h1>

<p>Generates a pseudo-random number.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>A, B</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Float</a></p>
    <p>The minimum and/or maximum number to be generated, specified in either order. If only one parameter is specified, the other parameter defaults to 0. If both are omitted, the default is 0.0 to 1.0.</p>
    <p>For integers, the minimum value and maximum value are both included in the set of possible numbers that may be returned. The full range of 64-bit integers is supported.</p>
    <p>For floating point numbers, the maximum value is generally excluded.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Float</a></p>
<p>This function returns a pseudo-randomly generated number, which is a number that simulates a true random number but is really a number based on a complicated formula to make determination/guessing of the next number extremely difficult.</p>
<p>If either <em>A</em> or <em>B</em> is a floating point number or both are omitted, the result will be a floating point number. Otherwise, the result will be an integer.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>All numbers within the specified range have approximately the same probability of being generated.</p>
<p>Although the specified maximum value is excluded by design, it may in theory be returned due to floating point rounding errors. This has not been confirmed, and might only be possible if the chosen bounds are larger than 2**53. Also note that since there may be up to 2**53 possible values (such as in the range 0.0 to 1.0), the probability of generating exactly the lower bound is generally very low.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>
<div class="ex" id="ExBasic">
<p><a class="ex_number" href="#ExBasic"></a> Generates a random integer in the range 1 to 10 and stores it in <var>N</var>.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Haystack</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The string whose content is searched. This may contain binary zero.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>NeedleRegEx</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The pattern to search for, which is a Perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE). The pattern's <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm#Options">options</a> (if any) must be included at the beginning of the string followed by a close-parenthesis. For example, the pattern <span class="regex"><span class="red">i)</span>abc.*123</span> would turn on the case-insensitive option and search for "abc", followed by zero or more occurrences of any character, followed by "123". If there are no options, the ")" is optional; for example, <span class="regex">)abc</span> is equivalent to <span class="regex">abc</span>.</p>
    <p>Although <em>NeedleRegEx</em> cannot contain binary zero, the pattern <code>\x00</code> can be used to match a binary zero within <em>Haystack</em>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>&amp;OutputVar</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a></p>
    <p>Specify a reference to a output variable in which to store a <a href="#MatchObject">match object</a>, which can be used to retrieve the position, length and value of the overall match and of each <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm#subpat">captured subpattern</a>, if any are present.</p>
    <p>If the pattern is not found (that is, if the function returns 0), this variable is made blank.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>StartingPos</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If <em>StartingPos</em> is omitted, it defaults to 1 (the beginning of <em>Haystack</em>). Otherwise, specify 2 to start at the second character, 3 to start at the third, and so on. If <em>StartingPos</em> is beyond the length of <em>Haystack</em>, the search starts at the empty string that lies at the end of <em>Haystack</em> (which typically results in no match).</p>
    <p>Specify a negative <em>StartingPos</em> to start at that position from the right. For example, -1 starts at the last character and -2 starts at the next-to-last character. If <em>StartingPos</em> tries to go beyond the left end of <em>Haystack</em>, all of <em>Haystack</em> is searched.</p>
    <p>Specify 0 to start at the end of <em>Haystack</em>; i.e. the position to the right of the last character. This can be used with zero-width assertions such as <code>(?&lt;=a)</code>.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the value of <em>StartingPos</em>, the return value is always relative to the first character of <em>Haystack</em>. For example, the position of "abc" in "123abc789" is always 4.</p>

<p>This function returns the position of the leftmost occurrence of <em>NeedleRegEx</em> in the string <em>Haystack</em>. Position 1 is the first character. Zero is returned if the pattern is not found.</p>

<p><strong>Syntax errors:</strong> If the pattern contains a syntax error, an <a href="Error.htm">Error</a> is thrown with a message in the following form: <em>Compile error N at offset M: description</em>. In that string, <em>N</em> is the PCRE error number, <em>M</em> is the position of the offending character inside the regular expression, and <em>description</em> is the text describing the error.</p>
<p><strong>Execution errors:</strong> If an error occurs during the <em>execution</em> of the regular expression, an <a href="Error.htm">Error</a> is thrown. The <em>Extra</em> property of the error object contains the PCRE error number. Although such errors are rare, the ones most likely to occur are "too many possible empty-string matches" (-22), "recursion too deep" (-21), and "reached match limit" (-8). If these happen, try to redesign the pattern to be more restrictive, such as replacing each * with a ?, +, or a limit like {0,3} wherever feasible.</p>

<h2 id="Options">Options</h2>
<p>See <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm#Options">Options</a> for modifiers such as <span class="regex"><span class="red">i)</span>abc</span>, which turns off case-sensitivity in the pattern "abc".</p>

<h2 id="MatchObject">Match Object (RegExMatchInfo)</h2>
<p>If a match is found, an object containing information about the match is stored in <em>OutputVar</em>. This object has the following methods and properties:</p>
<p><strong>Match.Pos</strong>, <strong>Match.Pos[N]</strong> or <strong>Match.Pos(N)</strong>: Returns the position of the overall match or a captured subpattern.</p>
<p><strong>Match.Len</strong>, <strong>Match.Len[N]</strong> or <strong>Match.Len(N)</strong>: Returns the length of the overall match or a captured subpattern.</p>
<p><strong>Match.Name[N]</strong> or <strong>Match.Name(N)</strong>: Returns the name of the given subpattern, if it has one.</p>
<p><strong>Match.Count</strong>: Returns the overall number of subpatterns (capturing groups), which is also the maximum value for <em>N</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Match.Mark</strong>: Returns the <em>NAME</em> of the last encountered <span class="regex">(*MARK:NAME)</span>, when applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Match[]</strong> or <strong>Match[N]</strong>: Returns the overall match or a captured subpattern.</p>
<p>All of the above allow <em>N</em> to be any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0 for the overall match.</li>
  <li>The number of a subpattern, even one that also has a name.</li>
  <li>The name of a subpattern.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Match.N</strong>: Shorthand for <strong>Match["N"]</strong>, where <em>N</em> is any unquoted name or number which does not conflict with a defined property (listed above). For example, <code>match.1</code> or <code>match.Year</code>.</p>
<p>The object also supports enumeration; that is, the <a href="For.htm">for-loop</a> is supported. Alternatively, use <code><a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a> Match.Count</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Performance">Performance</h2>
<p>To search for a simple substring inside a larger string, use <a href="InStr.htm">InStr</a> because it is faster than RegExMatch.</p>
<p>To improve performance, the 100 most recently used regular expressions are kept cached in memory (in compiled form).</p>
<p>The <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm#Study">study option (S)</a> can sometimes improve the performance of a regular expression that is used many times (such as in a loop).</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p id="NamedSubPat">A subpattern may be given a name such as the word <em>Year</em> in the pattern <span class="regex">(?P&lt;Year&gt;\d{4})</span>. Such names may consist of up to 32 alphanumeric characters and underscores. Note that named subpatterns are also numbered, so if an <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm#subpat">unnamed subpattern</a> occurs after "Year", it would be stored in <code>OutputVar[2]</code>, not <code>OutputVar[1]</code>.</p>
<p>Most characters like abc123 can be used literally inside a regular expression. However, the characters <strong>\.*?+[{|()^$</strong> must be preceded by a backslash to be seen as literal. For example, <strong>\.</strong> is a literal period and <strong>\\</strong> is a literal backslash. Escaping can be avoided by using \Q...\E. For example: <span class="regex">\QLiteral Text\E</span>.</p>
<p>Within a regular expression, special characters such as tab and newline can be escaped with either an accent (`) or a backslash (\). For example, `t is the same as \t except when the <b>x</b> option is used.</p>
<p>To learn the basics of regular expressions (or refresh your memory of pattern syntax), see the <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm">RegEx Quick Reference</a>.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey's regular expressions are implemented using Perl-compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) from <a href="http://www.pcre.org/">www.pcre.org</a>.</p>
<p>Within an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>, the <code>a <a href="../Variables.htm#regex">~=</a> b</code> can be used as shorthand for <code>RegExMatch(a, b)</code>.</p>

<h1>RegExReplace</h1>

<p>Replaces occurrences of a pattern (regular expression) inside a string.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">NewStr := <span class="func">RegExReplace</span>(Haystack, NeedleRegEx <span class="optional">, Replacement, &amp;OutputVarCount, Limit, StartingPos</span>)</pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Haystack</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The string whose content is searched and replaced. This may contain binary zero.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>NeedleRegEx</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The pattern to search for, which is a Perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE). The pattern's <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm#Options">options</a> (if any) must be included at the beginning of the string followed by a close-parenthesis. For example, the pattern <span class="regex"><span class="red">i)</span>abc.*123</span> would turn on the case-insensitive option and search for "abc", followed by zero or more occurrences of any character, followed by "123". If there are no options, the ")" is optional; for example, <span class="regex">)abc</span> is equivalent to <span class="regex">abc</span>.</p>
    <p>Although <em>NeedleRegEx</em> cannot contain binary zero, the pattern <code>\x00</code> can be used to match a binary zero within <em>Haystack</em>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Replacement</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p id="BackRef">The string to be substituted for each match, which is plain text (not a regular expression). It may include backreferences like $1, which brings in the substring from <em>Haystack</em> that matched the first <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm#subpat">subpattern</a>. The simplest backreferences are $0 through $9, where $0 is the substring that matched the entire pattern, $1 is the substring that matched the first subpattern, $2 is the second, and so on. For backreferences above 9 (and optionally those below 9), enclose the number in braces; e.g. ${10}, ${11}, and so on. For <a href="RegExMatch.htm#NamedSubPat">named subpatterns</a>, enclose the name in braces; e.g. ${SubpatternName}. To specify a literal $, use $$ (this is the only character that needs such special treatment; backslashes are never needed to escape anything).</p>
    <p>To convert the case of a subpattern, follow the $ with one of the following characters: U or u (uppercase), L or l (lowercase), T or t (title case, in which the first letter of each word is capitalized but all others are made lowercase). For example, both $U1 and $U{1} transcribe an uppercase version of the first subpattern.</p>
    <p>Nonexistent backreferences and those that did not match anything in <em>Haystack</em> -- such as one of the subpatterns in <span class="regex">(abc)|(xyz)</span> -- are transcribed as empty strings.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>&amp;OutputVarCount</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a></p>
    <p>Specify a reference to a output variable in which to store the number of replacements that occurred (0 if none).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Limit</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If <em>Limit</em> is omitted, it defaults to -1, which replaces <strong>all</strong> occurrences of the pattern found in <em>Haystack</em>. Otherwise, specify the maximum number of replacements to allow. The part of <em>Haystack</em> to the right of the last replacement is left unchanged.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>StartingPos</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If <em>StartingPos</em> is omitted, it defaults to 1 (the beginning of <em>Haystack</em>). Otherwise, specify 2 to start at the second character, 3 to start at the third, and so on.  If <em>StartingPos</em> is beyond the length of <em>Haystack</em>, the search starts at the empty string that lies at the end of <em>Haystack</em> (which typically results in no replacements).</p>
    <p>Specify a negative <em>StartingPos</em> to start at that position from the right. For example, -1 starts at the last character and -2 starts at the next-to-last character. If <em>StartingPos</em> tries to go beyond the left end of <em>Haystack</em>, all of <em>Haystack</em> is searched.</p>
    <p>Specify 0 to start at the end of <em>Haystack</em>; i.e. the position to the right of the last character. This can be used with zero-width assertions such as <code>(?&lt;=a)</code>.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the value of <em>StartingPos</em>, the return value is always a complete copy of <em>Haystack</em> -- the only difference is that more of its left side might be unaltered compared to what would have happened with a <em>StartingPos</em> of 1.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>This function returns a version of <em>Haystack</em> whose contents have been replaced by the operation. If no replacements are needed, <em>Haystack</em> is returned unaltered.</p>

<h2 id="Errors">Errors</h2>
<p>An <a href="Error.htm">Error</a> is thrown if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the pattern contains a syntax error; or</li>
  <li>an error occurred during the <em>execution</em> of the regular expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>For details, see <a href="RegExMatch.htm#Errors">RegExMatch</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm#Options">Options</a> for modifiers such as <span class="regex"><span class="red">i)</span>abc</span>, which turns off case-sensitivity in the pattern "abc".</p>
<h2 id="Performance">Performance</h2>
<p>To replace simple substrings, use <a href="StrReplace.htm">StrReplace</a> because it is faster than RegExReplace.</p>
<p>If you know what the maximum number of replacements will be, specifying that for the <em>Limit</em> parameter improves performance because the search can be stopped early (this might also reduce the memory load on the system during the operation). For example, if you know there can be only one match near the beginning of a large string, specify a limit of 1.</p>
<p>To improve performance, the 100 most recently used regular expressions are kept cached in memory (in compiled form).</p>
<p>The <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm#Study">study option (S)</a> can sometimes improve the performance of a regular expression that is used many times (such as in a loop).</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Currently only the following value types are supported: REG_SZ, REG_EXPAND_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ, REG_DWORD, and REG_BINARY.</p>
<p>REG_DWORD values are always expressed as positive decimal numbers. If the number was intended to be negative, convert it to a signed 32-bit integer by using <code>OutputVar := OutputVar &lt;&lt; 32 &gt;&gt; 32</code> or similar.</p>
<p>When reading a REG_BINARY key the result is a string of hex characters. For example, the REG_BINARY value of 01,a9,ff,77 will be read as the string 01A9FF77.</p>
<p>When reading a REG_MULTI_SZ key, each of the components ends in a linefeed character (`n). If there are no components, an empty string is returned. See <a href="FileSelect.htm">FileSelect</a> for an example of how to extract the individual components from the return value.</p>
<p>To retrieve and operate upon multiple registry keys or values, consider using a <a href="LoopReg.htm">registry-loop</a>.</p>

To access a <a href="LoopReg.htm#remote">remote registry</a>, prepend the computer name and a slash, as in this example: \\workstation01\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</p>
    <p><em>KeyName</em> can be omitted only if a <a href="LoopReg.htm">registry loop</a> is running, in which case it defaults to the key of the current loop item. If the item is a subkey, the full name of that subkey is used by default. If the item is a value, <em>ValueType</em> and <em>ValueName</em> default to the type and name of that value, but can be overridden.</p>

  <dt>ValueName</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>If <em>KeyName</em> specifies a subkey which does not exist, RegWrite attempts to create it (along with its ancestors, if necessary). Although RegWrite can write directly into a root key, some operating systems might refuse to write into HKEY_CURRENT_USER's top level.</p>
<p>To create a key without writing any values to it, use <a href="RegCreateKey.htm">RegCreateKey</a>.</p>
<p>If <em>ValueType</em> is REG_DWORD, <em>Value</em> should be between -2147483648 and 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF). In the registry, REG_DWORD values are always expressed as positive decimal numbers. To read it as a negative number with means such as <a href="RegRead.htm">RegRead</a>, convert it to a signed 32-bit integer by using <code>OutputVar := OutputVar &lt;&lt; 32 &gt;&gt; 32</code> or similar.</p>
<p>When writing a REG_BINARY key, use a string of hex characters, e.g. the REG_BINARY value of 01,a9,ff,77 can be written by using the string 01A9FF77.</p>
<p>When writing a REG_MULTI_SZ key, you must separate each component from the next with a linefeed character (`n). The last component may optionally end with a linefeed as well. No blank components are allowed. In other words, do not specify two linefeeds in a row (`n`n) because that will result in a shorter-than-expected value being written to the registry.</p>
<p>To retrieve and operate upon multiple registry keys or values, consider using a <a href="LoopReg.htm">registry-loop</a>.</p>

<h1>Reload</h1>

<p>Replaces the currently running instance of the script with a new one.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Reload</span></pre>
<p>This function is useful for scripts that are frequently changed. By assigning a hotkey to this function, you can easily restart the script after saving your changes in an editor.</p>
<p>By default, the script can also be reloaded via its <a href="../Program.htm#tray-icon">tray icon</a> or <a href="../Program.htm#main-window">main window</a>.</p>
<p>If the <a href="../Scripts.htm#SlashInclude">/include</a> switch was passed to the script's current instance, it is automatically passed to the new instance.</p>
<p>Any other <a href="../Scripts.htm#cmd">command-line parameters</a> passed to the script's current instance are not passed to the new instance. To pass such parameters, do not use Reload. Instead, use <a href="Run.htm">Run</a> in conjunction with <a href="../Variables.htm#AhkPath">A_AhkPath</a> and <a href="../Variables.htm#ScriptFullPath">A_ScriptFullPath</a> (and <a href="../Variables.htm#IsCompiled">A_IsCompiled</a> if the script is ever used in compiled form). Also, include the string <code>/restart</code> as the first parameter (i.e. after the name of the executable), which tells the program to use the same behavior as Reload. See also: <a href="../Scripts.htm#cmd">command line switches and syntax</a>.</p>
<p>When the script restarts, it is launched in its original working directory (the one that was in effect when it was first launched). In other words, <a href="SetWorkingDir.htm">SetWorkingDir</a> will not change the working directory that will be used for the new instance.</p>
<p>If the script cannot be reloaded -- perhaps because it has a syntax error -- the original instance of the script will continue running. Therefore, the reload function should be followed by whatever actions you want taken in the event of a failure (such as a <a href="Return.htm">return</a> to exit the current subroutine). To have the original instance detect the failure, follow this example:</p>
<pre>Reload
Sleep 1000 <em>; If successful, the reload will close this instance during the Sleep, so the line below will never be reached.</em>
Result := MsgBox("The script could not be reloaded. Would you like to open it for editing?",, 4)
if Result = "Yes"
    Edit
return</pre>
<p>Previous instances of the script are identified by the same mechanism as for <a href="_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a>, with the same <a href="_SingleInstance.htm#Limitations">limitations</a>.</p>
<p>If the script allows multiple instances, Reload may fail to identify the correct instance. The simplest alternative is to <a href="Run.htm">Run</a> a new instance and then exit. For example:</p>
<pre>if A_IsCompiled
    Run Format('"{1}" /force', A_ScriptFullPath)
else
    Run Format('"{1}" /force "{2}"', A_AhkPath, A_ScriptFullPath)
ExitApp</pre>

<h1>Run / RunWait</h1>

<p>Runs an external program. Unlike Run, RunWait will wait until the program finishes before continuing.</p>

ExitCode := <span class="func">RunWait</span>(Target <span class="optional">, WorkingDir, Options, &amp;OutputVarPID</span>)
</pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Target</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>A document, URL, executable file (.exe, .com, .bat, etc.), shortcut (.lnk), or <a href="#verbs">system verb</a> to launch (see remarks). If <em>Target</em> is a local file and no path was specified with it, <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> will be searched first. If no matching file is found there, the system will search for and launch the file if it is integrated ("known"), e.g. by being contained in one of the PATH folders.</p>
      <p>To pass parameters, add them immediately after the program or document name. For example, <code>Run 'MyProgram.exe Param1 Param2'</code>.</p>
      <p>If the program/document name or a parameter contains spaces, it is safest to enclose it in double quotes (even though it may work without them in some cases). For example, <code>Run '"My Program.exe" "param with spaces"'</code>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>WorkingDir</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>The working directory for the launched item. If omitted, the script's own working directory (<a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a>) will be used.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Options</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>If omitted, the function launches <em>Target</em> normally. To change this behavior, specify one or more of the following words:</p>
      <p><strong>Max</strong>: launch maximized</p>
      <p><strong>Min</strong>: launch minimized</p>
      <p><strong>Hide</strong>: launch hidden (cannot be used in combination with either of the above)</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Some applications (e.g. Calc.exe) do not obey the requested startup state and thus Max/Min/Hide will have no effect.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>&amp;OutputVarPID</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a></p>
      <p>A reference to the output variable in which to store the newly launched program's unique <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_pid">Process ID (PID)</a>. The variable will be made blank if the PID could not be determined, which usually happens if a system verb, document, or shortcut is launched rather than a direct executable file. RunWait also supports this parameter, though its <em>OutputVarPID</em> must be checked in <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">another thread</a> (otherwise, the PID will be invalid because the process will have terminated by the time the line following RunWait executes).</p>
      <p>After the Run function retrieves a PID, any windows to be created by the process might not exist yet. To wait for at least one window to be created, use <code><a href="WinWait.htm">WinWait</a> "ahk_pid " OutputVarPID</code>.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>Unlike Run, RunWait will wait until <em>Target</em> is closed or exits, at which time the return value will be the program's exit code (as a signed 32-bit integer). Some programs will appear to return immediately even though they are still running; these programs spawn another process.</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>If <em>Target</em> cannot be launched, an exception is thrown (that is, an error window is displayed) and the current thread is exited, unless the error is caught by a <a href="Try.htm">Try</a>/<a href="Catch.htm">Catch</a> statement. For example:</p>
<pre>try
    Run "NonExistingFile"
catch
    MsgBox "File does not exist."
</pre>
<p>The built-in variable <a href="../Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> is set to the result of the operating system's GetLastError() function.</p>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>When running a program via <a href="../Variables.htm#ComSpec">ComSpec</a> (cmd.exe) -- perhaps because you need to redirect the program's input or output -- if the path or name of the executable contains spaces, the entire string should be enclosed in an outer pair of quotes. In the following example, the outer quotes are highlighted in yellow:</p>
<pre>Run A_ComSpec ' /c <span class="style3">"</span>"C:\My Utility.exe" "param 1" "second param" &gt;"C:\My File.txt"<span class="style3">"</span>'</pre>
<p>Performance may be slightly improved if <em>Target</em> is an exact path, e.g. <code>Run 'C:\Windows\Notepad.exe "C:\My Documents\Test.txt"'</code> rather than <code>Run "C:\My Documents\Test.txt"</code>.</p>
<p>Special <a href="../misc/CLSID-List.htm">CLSID folders</a> may be opened via Run. For example:</p>
<pre>Run "::{20d04fe0-3aea-1069-a2d8-08002b30309d}"  <em>; Opens the "My Computer" folder.</em>
Run "::{645ff040-5081-101b-9f08-00aa002f954e}"  <em>; Opens the Recycle Bin.</em></pre>
<p id="verbs">System verbs correspond to actions available in a file's right-click menu in the Explorer. If a file is launched without a verb, the default verb (usually "open") for that particular file type will be used. If specified, the verb should be followed by the name of the target file. The following verbs are currently supported:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr>
    <th style="width:8%">Verb</th>
    <th abbr="Descr">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>*<i>verb</i></td>
    <td>Any system-defined or custom verb. For example: <code>Run "*Compile " A_ScriptFullPath</code>. The <a href="#RunAs">*RunAs</a> verb may be used in place of the <i>Run as administrator</i> right-click menu item.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>properties</td>
    <td>
      <p>Displays the Explorer's properties window for the indicated file. For example: <code>Run 'properties "C:\My File.txt"'</code></p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The properties window will automatically close when the script terminates. To prevent this, use <a href="WinWait.htm">WinWait</a> to wait for the window to appear, then use <a href="WinWaitClose.htm">WinWaitClose</a> to wait for the user to close it.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>find</td>
    <td>Opens an instance of the Explorer's Search Companion or Find File window at the indicated folder. For example: <code>Run "find D:\"</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>explore</td>
    <td>Opens an instance of Explorer at the indicated folder. For example: <code>Run "explore " A_ProgramFiles</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>edit</td>
    <td>Opens the indicated file for editing. It might not work if the indicated file's type does not have an "edit" action associated with it. For example: <code>Run 'edit "C:\My File.txt"'</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>open</td>
    <td>Opens the indicated file (normally not needed because it is the default action for most file types). For example: <code>Run 'open "My File.txt"'</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>print</td>
    <td>Prints the indicated file with the associated application, if any. For example: <code>Run 'print "My File.txt"'</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>While RunWait is in a waiting state, new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> can be launched via <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="RunAs">Run as Administrator</h2>
<p>For an executable file, the <em>*RunAs</em> verb is equivalent to selecting <em>Run as administrator</em> from the right-click menu of the file. For example, the following code attempts to restart the current script as admin:</p>
<pre>full_command_line := DllCall("GetCommandLine", "str")

if not (A_IsAdmin or RegExMatch(full_command_line, " /restart(?!\S)"))
{
    try
    {
        if A_IsCompiled
            Run '*RunAs "' A_ScriptFullPath '" /restart'
        else
            Run '*RunAs "' A_AhkPath '" /restart "' A_ScriptFullPath '"'
    }
    ExitApp
}

MsgBox "A_IsAdmin: " A_IsAdmin "`nCommand line: " full_command_line</pre>
<p>If the user cancels the UAC dialog or Run fails for some other reason, the script will simply exit.</p>
<p>Using <a href="../Scripts.htm#SlashR">/restart</a> ensures that a <a href="_SingleInstance.htm">single instance</a> prompt is not shown if the new instance of the script starts before ExitApp is called.</p>
<p>If UAC is disabled, <em>*RunAs</em> will launch the process without elevating it. Checking for <code>/restart</code> in the command line ensures that the script does not enter a runaway loop in that case. Note that <code>/restart</code> is a built-in switch, so is not included in the <a href="../Scripts.htm#cmd_args">array of command-line parameters</a>.</p>
<p>The example can be modified to fit the script's needs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the script absolutely requires admin rights, check A_IsAdmin a second time in case <em>*RunAs</em> failed to elevate the script (i.e. because UAC is disabled).</li>
  <li>To keep the script running even if the user cancels the UAC prompt, move ExitApp into the try block.</li>
  <li>To keep the script running even if it failed to restart (i.e. because the script file has been changed or deleted), remove ExitApp and use RunWait instead of Run. On success, <code>/restart</code> causes the new instance to terminate the old one. On failure, the new instance exits and RunWait returns.</li>
</ul>
<p>AutoHotkey's installer registers the <em>RunAs</em> verb for <em>.ahk</em> files, which allows <code>Run "*RunAs script.ahk"</code> to launch a script as admin.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: As capital letters are produced by sending <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <code>A</code> produces a different effect in some programs than <code>a</code>. For example, <code>!A</code> presses <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> and <code>!a</code> presses <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. If in doubt, use lowercase.</p>
    <p>The characters <code>{}</code> are used to enclose <a href="#keynames">key names and other options</a>, and to send special characters literally. For example, <code>{Tab}</code> is <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <code>{!}</code> is a literal exclamation mark.</p>
    <p>Enclosing a plain ASCII letter (a-z or A-Z) in braces forces it to be sent as the corresponding virtual keycode, even if the character does not exist on the current keyboard layout. In other words, <code>Send "a"</code> produces the letter "a" while <code>Send "{a}"</code> may or may not produce "a", depending on the keyboard layout. For details, see the <a href="#AZ">remarks below</a>.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Send_variants">Send variants</h2>
<p><strong>Send:</strong> By default, Send is synonymous with SendInput; but it can be made a synonym for SendEvent or SendPlay via <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SendText:</strong> Similar to Send, except that all characters in <em>Keys</em> are interpreted and sent literally. See <a href="#Text">Text mode</a> for details.</p>
<p><strong id="SendInput">SendInput</strong> and <strong id="SendPlay">SendPlay</strong>: SendInput and SendPlay use the same syntax as SendEvent but are generally faster and more reliable. In addition, they buffer any physical keyboard or mouse activity during the send, which prevents the user's keystrokes from being interspersed with those being sent. <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> can be used to make Send synonymous with SendInput or SendPlay. For more details about each mode, see <a href="#SendInputDetail">SendInput</a> and <a href="#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a> below.</p>
<p id="SendEvent"><strong>SendEvent</strong>: SendEvent sends keystrokes using the Windows keybd_event function (search Microsoft Docs for details). The rate at which keystrokes are sent is determined by <a href="SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a>. <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> can be used to make Send synonymous with SendEvent or SendPlay.</p>

<h2 id="Special_modes">Special modes</h2>
<p>The following modes affect the interpretation of the characters in <em>Keys</em> or the behavior of key-sending functions such as Send, SendInput, SendPlay, SendEvent and <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a>. These modes must be specified as <code>{x}</code> in <em>Keys</em>, where x is either Raw, Text, or Blind. For example, <code>{Raw}</code>.</p>

<h3 id="Raw">Raw mode</h3>
<p id="SendRaw">The Raw mode can be enabled with <code>{Raw}</code>, which causes all subsequent characters, including the special characters <code>^+!#{}</code>, to be interpreted literally rather than translating <code>{Enter}</code> to <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <code>^c</code> to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, etc. For example, <code>Send "{Raw}{Tab}"</code> sends <code>{Tab}</code> instead of <kbd>Tab</kbd>.</p>
<p>The Raw mode does not affect the interpretation of <a href="../misc/EscapeChar.htm">escape sequences</a> and <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expressions</a>. For example, <code>Send "{Raw}``100`%"</code> sends the string <code class="no-highlight">`100%</code>.</p>

<h3 id="Text">Text mode</h3>
<p id="SendText">The Text mode can be either enabled with <code>{Text}</code>, SendText or <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSendText</a>, which is similar to the Raw mode, except that no attempt is made to translate characters (other than <code>`r</code>, <code>`n</code>, <code>`t</code> and <code>`b</code>) to keycodes; instead, the <a href="#fallback">fallback method</a> is used for all of the remaining characters. For SendEvent, SendInput and <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a>, this improves reliability because the characters are much less dependent on correct modifier state. This mode can be combined with the Blind mode to avoid releasing any modifier keys: <code>Send "{Blind}{Text}your text"</code>. However, some applications require that the modifier keys be released.</p>
<p><code>`n</code>, <code>`r</code> and <code>`r`n</code> are all translated to a single <kbd>Enter</kbd>, unlike the default behavior and Raw mode, which translate <code>`r`n</code> to two <kbd>Enter</kbd>. <code>`t</code> is translated to <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <code>`b</code> to <kbd>Backspace</kbd>, but all other characters are sent without translation.</p>
<p>Like the Blind mode, the Text mode ignores <a href="SetStoreCapsLockMode.htm">SetStoreCapsLockMode</a> (that is, the state of <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> is not changed) and does not <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#win-l">wait for <kbd>Win</kbd> to be released</a>. This is because the Text mode typically does not depend on the state of <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> and cannot trigger the system <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> hotkey. However, this only applies when <em>Keys</em> begins with <code>{Text}</code> or <code>{Blind}{Text}</code>.</p>

<h3 id="Blind">Blind mode</h3>
<p id="blind">The Blind mode can be enabled with <code>{Blind}</code>, which gives the script more control by disabling a number of things that are normally done automatically to make things work as expected. <code>{Blind}</code> must be the first item in the string to enable the Blind mode. It has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Blind mode avoids releasing the modifier keys (Alt, Ctrl, Shift, and Win) if they started out in the down position, unless the modifier is <a href="#blind-exclude">excluded</a>. For example, the hotkey <code>+s::Send "{Blind}abc"</code> would send ABC rather than abc because the user is holding down <kbd>Shift</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Modifier keys are restored differently to allow a Send to turn off a hotkey's modifiers even if the user is still physically holding them down. For example, <code>^space::Send "{Ctrl up}"</code> automatically pushes <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> back down if the user is still physically holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, whereas <code>^space::Send "{Blind}{Ctrl up}"</code> allows <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to be logically up even though it is physically down.</li>
  <li><a href="SetStoreCapsLockMode.htm">SetStoreCapsLockMode</a> is ignored; that is, the state of <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> is not changed.</li>
  <li><a href="A_MenuMaskKey.htm">Menu masking</a> is disabled. That is, Send omits the extra keystrokes that would otherwise be sent in order to prevent: 1) Start Menu appearance during Win keystrokes (LWin/RWin); 2) menu bar activation during Alt keystrokes. However, the Blind mode does not prevent masking performed by the keyboard hook following activation of a hook hotkey.</li>
  <li>Send does not wait for <kbd>Win</kbd> to be released even if the text contains an <kbd>L</kbd> keystroke. This would normally be done to prevent Send from triggering the system "lock workstation" hotkey (<kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>). See <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#win-l">Hotkeys</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
<p id="blind-exclude">The word "Blind" may be followed by one or more modifier symbols (<code>!#^+</code>) to allow those modifiers to be released automatically if needed. For example, <code>*^a::Send "{Blind^}b"</code> would send <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> instead of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> if <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> was pressed. <code>{Blind!#^+}</code> allows all modifiers to be released if needed, but enables the other effects of the Blind mode.</p>
<p>The Blind mode is used internally when <a href="../misc/Remap.htm">remapping a key</a>. For example, the remapping <code>a::b</code> would produce: 1) "b" when you type "a"; 2) uppercase "B" when you type uppercase "A"; and 3) <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> when you type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. If any modifiers are specified for the source key (including <kbd>Shift</kbd> if the source key is an uppercase letter), they are excluded as described above. For example <code>^a::b</code> produces normal <kbd>B</kbd>, not <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>.</p>
<p><code>{Blind}</code> is not supported by SendText or <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSendText</a>; use <code>{Blind}{Text}</code> instead.</p>
<p>The Blind mode is not completely supported by <a href="#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a>, especially when dealing with the modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and Win).</p>

<h2 id="Repeating_or_Holding_Down_a_Key">Repeating or Holding Down a Key</h2>
<p id="repeat"><strong>To repeat a keystroke</strong>: Enclose in braces the name of the key followed by the number of times to repeat it. For example:</p>
<pre>Send "{DEL 4}"  <em>; Presses the Delete key 4 times.</em>
Send "{S 30}"   <em>; Sends 30 uppercase S characters.</em>
Send "+{TAB 4}"  <em>; Presses Shift-Tab 4 times.</em></pre>
<p id="Down"><strong>To hold down or release a key</strong>: Enclose in braces the name of the key followed by the word <strong>Down</strong> or <strong>Up</strong>. For example:</p>
<pre>Send "{b down}{b up}"
Send "{TAB down}{TAB up}"
Send "{Up down}"  <em>; Press down the up-arrow key.</em>
Sleep 1000  <em>; Keep it down for one second.</em>
Send "{Up up}"  <em>; Release the up-arrow key.</em></pre>
<p>When a key is held down via the method above, it does not begin auto-repeating like it would if you were physically holding it down (this is because auto-repeat is a driver/hardware feature). However, a <a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a> can be used to simulate auto-repeat. The following example sends 20 tab keystrokes:</p>
<pre>Loop 20
{
    Send "{Tab down}"  <em>; Auto-repeat consists of consecutive down-events (with no up-events).</em>
    Sleep 30  <em>; The number of milliseconds between keystrokes (or use <a href="SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a>).</em>
}
Send "{Tab up}"  <em>; Release the key.</em></pre>
<p>By default, Send will not automatically release a modifier key (Control, Shift, Alt, and Win) if that modifier key was "pressed down" by sending it. For example, <code>Send "a"</code> may behave similar to <code>Send "<a href="#blind">{Blind}</a>{Ctrl up}a{Ctrl down}"</code> if the user is physically holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, but <code>Send "{Ctrl Down}"</code> followed by <code>Send "a"</code> will produce <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. <em>DownTemp</em> and <em>DownR</em> can be used to override this behavior. <em>DownTemp</em> and <em>DownR</em> have the same effect as <em>Down</em> except for the modifier keys (Control, Shift, Alt, and Win).</p>
<p id="DownTemp"><strong>DownTemp</strong> tells subsequent sends that the key is not permanently down, and may be released whenever a keystroke calls for it. For example, <code>Send "{Control DownTemp}"</code> followed later by <code>Send "a"</code> would produce <kbd>A</kbd>, not <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. Any use of Send may potentially release the modifier permanently, so <em>DownTemp</em> is not ideal for <a href="../misc/Remap.htm">remapping</a> modifier keys.</p>
<p id="DownR"><strong>DownR</strong> (where "R" stands for <a href="../misc/Remap.htm">remapping</a>, which is its main use) tells subsequent sends that if the key is automatically released, it should be pressed down again when send is finished. For example, <code>Send "{Control DownR}"</code> followed later by <code>Send "a"</code> would produce <kbd>A</kbd>, not <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>, but will leave <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> in the pressed state for use with keyboard shortcuts. In other words, <em>DownR</em> has an effect similar to physically pressing the key.</p>
<p>If a character does not correspond to a virtual key on the current keyboard layout, it cannot be "pressed" or "released". For example, <code>Send "{µ up}"</code> has no effect on most layouts, and <code>Send "{µ down}"</code> is equivalent to <code>Send "µ"</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">General Remarks</h2>
<p id="characters"><strong>Characters vs. keys</strong>: By default, characters are sent by first translating them to keystrokes. If this translation is not possible (that is, if the current keyboard layout does not contain a key or key combination which produces that character), the character is sent by one of following fallback methods:</p>
<ul id="fallback">
  <li>SendEvent and SendInput use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-sendinput">SendInput()</a> with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-keybdinput#keyeventf_unicode">KEYEVENTF_UNICODE flag</a>.</li>
  <li>SendPlay uses the <a href="#asc">Alt+nnnnn</a> method, which produces Unicode only if supported by the target application.</li>
  <li>ControlSend posts a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/inputdev/wm-char">WM_CHAR</a> message.</li>
</ul>
<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Characters sent using any of the above methods usually do not trigger keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys.</p>
<p id="AZ">For characters in the range <strong>a-z</strong> or <strong>A-Z</strong> (plain ASCII letters), each character which does not exist in the current keyboard layout may be sent either as a character or as the corresponding virtual keycode (vk41-vk5A):</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a naked letter is sent (that is, without modifiers or braces), or if <a href="#Raw">Raw</a> mode is in effect, it is sent as a character. For example, <code>Send "{Raw}Regards"</code> sends the expected text, even though pressing <kbd>R</kbd> (vk52) produces some other character (such as <kbd>К</kbd> on the Russian layout). <code>{Raw}</code> can be omitted in this case, unless a modifier key was put into effect by a prior Send.</li>
  <li>If one or more modifier keys have been put into effect by the Send function, or if the letter is wrapped in braces, it is sent as a keycode (modified with <kbd>Shift</kbd> if the letter is upper-case). This allows the script to easily activate standard keyboard shortcuts. For example, <code>^c</code> and <code>{Ctrl down}c{Ctrl up}</code> activate the standard <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> shortcut and <code>{c}</code> is equivalent to <code>{vk43}</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the letter exists in the current keyboard layout, it is always sent as whichever keycode the layout associates with that letter (unless the <a href="#SendText">Text mode</a> is used, in which case the character is sent by other means). In other words, the section above is only relevant for non-Latin based layouts such as Russian.</p>
<p id="mask"><strong>Modifier State</strong>: When Send is required to change the state of the <kbd>Win</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd> modifier keys (such as if the user was holding one of those keys), it may inject additional keystrokes (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> by default) to prevent the Start menu or window menu from appearing. For details, see <a href="A_MenuMaskKey.htm">A_MenuMaskKey</a>.</p>
<p><strong>BlockInput Compared to SendInput/SendPlay</strong>: Although the <a href="BlockInput.htm">BlockInput</a> function can be used to prevent any keystrokes physically typed by the user from disrupting the flow of simulated keystrokes, it is often better to use <a href="#SendInputDetail">SendInput</a> or <a href="#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a> so that keystrokes and mouse clicks become uninterruptible. This is because unlike BlockInput, SendInput/Play does not discard what the user types during the send; instead, such keystrokes are buffered and sent afterward.</p>
<p>When sending a large number of keystrokes, a <a href="../Scripts.htm#continuation">continuation section</a> can be used to improve readability and maintainability.</p>
<p>Since the operating system does not allow simulation of the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd> combination, doing something like <code>Send "^!{Delete}"</code> will have no effect.</p>
<p><b>Send may have no effect</b> if the active window is running with administrative privileges and the script is not. This is due to a security mechanism called User Interface Privilege Isolation.</p>

<h2 id="SendInputDetail">SendInput</h2>
<p>SendInput is generally the preferred method to send keystrokes and mouse clicks because of its superior speed and reliability. Under most conditions, SendInput is nearly instantaneous, even when sending long strings. Since SendInput is so fast, it is also more reliable because there is less opportunity for some other window to pop up unexpectedly and intercept the keystrokes. Reliability is further improved by the fact that anything the user types during a SendInput is postponed until afterward.</p>
<p>Unlike the other sending modes, the operating system limits SendInput to about 5000 characters (this may vary depending on the operating system's version and performance settings). Characters and events beyond this limit are not sent.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> SendInput ignores SetKeyDelay because the operating system does not support a delay in this mode. However, when SendInput reverts to <a href="#SendEvent">SendEvent</a> under the conditions described below, it uses <code><a href="SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a> -1, 0</code> (unless SendEvent's KeyDelay is <code>-1,-1</code>, in which case <code>-1,-1</code> is used). When SendInput reverts to <a href="#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a>, it uses SendPlay's KeyDelay.</p>
<p id="SendInputUnavail">If a script <em>other than</em> the one executing SendInput has a <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">low-level keyboard hook</a> installed, SendInput automatically reverts to <a href="#SendEvent">SendEvent</a> (or <a href="#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a> if <code><a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> "InputThenPlay"</code> is in effect). This is done because the presence of an external hook disables all of SendInput's advantages, making it inferior to both SendPlay and SendEvent. However, since SendInput is unable to detect a low-level hook in programs other than AutoHotkey v1.0.43+, it will not revert in these cases, making it less reliable than SendPlay/Event.</p>
<p>When SendInput sends mouse clicks by means such as <a href="#Click">{Click}</a>, and <code><a href="CoordMode.htm">CoordMode</a> "Mouse", "Window"</code> or <code>CoordMode "Mouse", "Client"</code> is in effect, every click will be relative to the window that was active at the start of the send. Therefore, if SendInput intentionally activates another window (by means such as alt-tab), the coordinates of subsequent clicks within the same function will be wrong if they were intended to be relative to the new window rather than the old one.</p>

<h2 id="SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</h2>
<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> SendPlay may have no effect at all if UAC is enabled, even if the script is running as an administrator. For more information, refer to the <a href="../FAQ.htm#uac">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>SendPlay's biggest advantage is its ability to "play back" keystrokes and mouse clicks in a broader variety of games than the other modes. For example, a particular game may accept <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#SendMode">hotstrings</a> only when they have the <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#SendMode">SendPlay option</a>.</p>
<p>Of the three sending modes, SendPlay is the most unusual because it does not simulate keystrokes and mouse clicks per se. Instead, it creates a series of events (messages) that flow directly to the active window (similar to <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a>, but at a lower level). Consequently, SendPlay does not trigger hotkeys or hotstrings.</p>
<p>Like <a href="#SendInputDetail">SendInput</a>, SendPlay's keystrokes do not get interspersed with keystrokes typed by the user. Thus, if the user happens to type something during a SendPlay, those keystrokes are postponed until afterward.</p>
<p>Although SendPlay is considerably slower than SendInput, it is usually faster than the traditional <a href="#SendEvent">SendEvent</a> mode (even when <a href="SetKeyDelay.htm">KeyDelay</a> is -1).</p>
<p>Both <kbd>Win</kbd> (LWin and RWin) are automatically blocked during a SendPlay if the <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard hook</a> is installed. This prevents the Start Menu from appearing if the user accidentally presses <kbd>Win</kbd> during the send. By contrast, keys other than LWin and RWin do not need to be blocked because the operating system automatically postpones them until after the SendPlay (via buffering).</p>
<p>SendPlay does not use the standard settings of <a href="SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a> and <a href="SetMouseDelay.htm">SetMouseDelay</a>. Instead, it defaults to no delay at all, which can be changed as shown in the following examples:</p>
<pre><a href="SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a> 0, 10, <strong>"Play"</strong>  <em>; Note that both 0 and -1 are the same in SendPlay mode.</em>
<a href="SetMouseDelay.htm">SetMouseDelay</a> 10, <strong>"Play"</strong></pre>
<p>SendPlay is unable to turn on or off <kbd>CapsLock</kbd>, <kbd>NumLock</kbd>, or <kbd>ScrollLock</kbd>. Similarly, it is unable to change a key's state as seen by <a href="GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a> unless the keystrokes are sent to one of the script's own windows. Even then, any changes to the left/right modifier keys (e.g. RControl) can be detected only via their neutral counterparts (e.g. Control). Also, SendPlay has other limitations described on the <a href="SendMode.htm#Play">SendMode page</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="#SendInputDetail">SendInput</a> and <a href="#SendEvent">SendEvent</a>, the user may interrupt a SendPlay by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd>. When this happens, the remaining keystrokes are not sent but the script continues executing as though the SendPlay had completed normally.</p>
<p>Although SendPlay can send LWin and RWin events, they are sent directly to the active window rather than performing their native operating system function. To work around this, use <a href="#SendEvent">SendEvent</a>. For example, <code>SendEvent "#r"</code> would show the Start Menu's Run dialog.</p>

<h2 id="General_Remarks">General Remarks</h2>
<p>By default, <a href="_UseHook.htm">hook</a> <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> and <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a> ignore keyboard and mouse events generated by any AutoHotkey script. In some cases it can be useful to override this behaviour; for instance, to allow a remapped key to be used to trigger other hotkeys. SendLevel and <a href="_InputLevel.htm">#InputLevel</a> provide the means to achieve this.</p>
<p>SendLevel sets the level for events generated by the current <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">script thread</a>, while #InputLevel sets the level for any hotkeys or hotstrings beneath it. For any event generated by a script to trigger a hook hotkey or hotstring, the send level of the event must be higher than the input level of the hotkey or hotstring.</p>
<p>Compatibility:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Send.htm#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a> is not affected by SendLevel.</li>
  <li><a href="Send.htm#SendInputDetail">SendInput</a> is affected by SendLevel, but the script's own hook hotkeys cannot be activated while a SendInput is in progress, since it temporarily deactivates the hook. However, when Send or SendInput <a href="Send.htm#SendInputUnavail">reverts to SendEvent</a>, it is able to activate the script's own hotkeys.</li>
  <li>Hotkeys using the <a href="ListHotkeys.htm">"reg"</a> method are incapable of distinguishing physical and artificial input, so are not affected by SendLevel. However, hotkeys above level 0 always use the keyboard or mouse hook.</li>
  <li><a href="../Hotstrings.htm">Hotstrings</a> use #InputLevel only to determine whether the last typed character should trigger a hotstring. For instance, the hotstring <code>::btw::</code> can be triggered regardless of #InputLevel by sending <code>btw</code> at level 1 or higher and physically typing an <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#EndChars">ending character</a>. This is because hotstring recognition works by collecting input from all levels except level 0 into a single global buffer.</li>

  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#objects">Object</a></p>
    <p>The message parameters. If omitted, each parameter defaults to 0.</p>
    <p>Each parameter must be an <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">integer</a> or an object with a <a href="Buffer.htm#Ptr">Ptr</a> property, such as a <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a>. For messages which require a pointer to a string, use a Buffer or the <a href="StrPtr.htm">StrPtr</a> function. If the string contained by a variable is changed by passing the variable's address to SendMessage, the variable's length must be updated afterward by calling <a href="VarSetStrCapacity.htm#neg1">VarSetStrCapacity(&amp;MyVar, -1)</a>.</p>
    <p>If AutoHotkey or the target window is 32-bit, only the parameter's low 32 bits are used; that is, values are truncated if outside the range -2147483648 to 2147483647 (-0x80000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF) for signed values, or 0 to 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF) for unsigned values. If AutoHotkey and the target window are both 64-bit, any integer value <a href="../Concepts.htm#pure-numbers">supported by AutoHotkey</a> can be used.</p>

    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a>, <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Objects.htm">Object</a></p>
    <p>If this parameter is omitted, the message will be sent directly to the target window rather than one of its controls. Otherwise, this parameter can be the control's ClassNN, text or HWND, or an object with a <code>Hwnd</code> property. For details, see <a href="Control.htm#Parameter">The Control Parameter</a>.</p>
    <p>If this parameter specifies a HWND (as an integer or object), it is not required to be the HWND of a control (child window). That is, it can also be the HWND of a top-level window.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>WinTitle</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a>, <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Objects.htm">Object</a></p>

  </dd>

  <dt>WinText</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>If present, this parameter must be a substring from a single text element of the target window (as revealed by the included Window Spy utility). Hidden text elements are detected if <a href="DetectHiddenText.htm">DetectHiddenText</a> is ON.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>ExcludeTitle</dt>

  </dd>

  <dt>Timeout</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The maximum number of milliseconds to wait for the target window to process the message. If omitted, it defaults to 5000 (milliseconds). If the message is not processed within this time, a <a href="Error.htm#TimeoutError">TimeoutError</a> is thrown.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>This function returns the result of the message, which might sometimes be a "reply" depending on the nature of the message and its target window.</p>
<p>The range of possible values depends on the target window and the version of AutoHotkey that is running.  When using a 32-bit version of AutoHotkey, or if the target window is 32-bit, the result is a 32-bit unsigned integer between 0 and 4294967295. When using the 64-bit version of AutoHotkey with a 64-bit window, the result is a 64-bit signed integer between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807.</p>
<p>If the result is intended to be a 32-bit signed integer (a value from -2147483648 to 2147483648), it can be truncated to 32-bit and converted to a signed value as follows:</p>
<pre>MsgReply := MsgReply &lt;&lt; 32 &gt;&gt; 32</pre>
<p>This conversion may be necessary even on AutoHotkey 64-bit, because results from 32-bit windows are zero-extended. For example, a result of -1 from a 32-bit window is seen as 0xFFFFFFFF on any version of AutoHotkey, whereas a result of -1 from a 64-bit window is seen as 0xFFFFFFFF on AutoHotkey 32-bit and -1 on AutoHotkey 64-bit.</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#TargetError">TargetError</a> is thrown if the window or control could not be found.</p>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#TimeoutError">TimeoutError</a> is thrown if the message timed out.</p>
<p>An <a href="Error.htm#OSError">OSError</a> is thrown if a message could not be sent. For example, if the target window is running at a higher integrity level than the script (i.e. it is running as admin while the script is not), messages may be blocked.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This function should be used with caution because sending a message to the wrong window (or sending an invalid message) might cause unexpected behavior or even crash the target application. This is because most applications are not designed to expect certain types of messages from external sources.</p>
<p>SendMessage waits for the target window to process the message, up until the timeout period expires. By contrast, <a href="PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a> places the message in the message queue associated with the target window without waiting for acknowledgement or reply.</p>
<p>String parameters must be passed by <a href="StrPtr.htm">address</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>ListVars
WinWaitActive "ahk_class AutoHotkey"
SendMessage 0x000C, 0, StrPtr("New Title")  <em>; 0X000C is WM_SETTEXT</em></pre>
<p>To send a message to all windows in the system, including those that are hidden or disabled, specify <code>0xFFFF</code> for <em>WinTitle</em> (0xFFFF is HWND_BROADCAST). This technique should be used only for messages intended to be broadcast, such as the following example:</p>
<pre>SendMessage 0x001A,,,, 0xFFFF  <em>; 0x001A is WM_SETTINGCHANGE</em></pre>
<p>To have a script receive a message, use <a href="OnMessage.htm">OnMessage</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../misc/SendMessage.htm">Message Tutorial</a> for an introduction to using this function.</p>
<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>

    <p><strong>Input</strong>: This is the starting default used by all scripts. It uses the <a href="Send.htm#SendInput">SendInput</a> method for <a href="Send.htm">Send</a>, <a href="Send.htm">SendText</a>, <a href="Click.htm">Click</a>, and <a href="MouseMove.htm">MouseMove</a>/<a href="MouseClick.htm">Click</a>/<a href="MouseClickDrag.htm">Drag</a>. Known limitations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Windows Explorer ignores SendInput's simulation of certain navigational hotkeys such as <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>&larr;</kbd>. To work around this, use either <code>SendEvent "!{Left}"</code> or <code>SendInput "{Backspace}"</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>InputThenPlay</strong>: Same as above except that rather than falling back to Event mode when SendInput is <a href="Send.htm#SendInputUnavail">unavailable</a>, it reverts to Play mode (below). This also causes the <a href="Send.htm#SendInput">SendInput function</a> itself to revert to Play mode when SendInput is unavailable.</p>
    <p id="Play"><strong>Play</strong>: Switches to the <a href="Send.htm#SendPlay">SendPlay</a> method for <a href="Send.htm">Send</a>, <a href="Send.htm">SendText</a>, <a href="Click.htm">Click</a>, and <a href="MouseMove.htm">MouseMove</a>/<a href="MouseClick.htm">Click</a>/<a href="MouseClickDrag.htm">Drag</a>. Known limitations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Characters that do not exist in the current keyboard layout (such as &Ocirc; in English) cannot be sent. To work around this, use <a href="Send.htm#SendEvent">SendEvent</a>.</li>
      <li>Simulated mouse dragging might have no effect in RichEdit controls (and possibly others) such as those of WordPad and Metapad. To use an alternate mode for a particular drag, follow this example: <code><a href="Send.htm#SendEvent">SendEvent</a> "{Click 6 52 Down}{Click 45 52 Up}"</code>.</li>
      <li>Simulated mouse wheel rotation produces movement in only one direction (usually downward, but upward in some applications). Also, wheel rotation might have no effect in applications such as MS Word and Notepad. To use an alternate mode for a particular rotation, follow this example: <code><a href="Send.htm#SendEvent">SendEvent</a> "{WheelDown 5}"</code>.</li>
      <li>If <code>SendMode "Play"</code> is called during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>, all remapped keys are affected and might lose some of their functionality. See <a href="../misc/Remap.htm#SendPlay">SendPlay remapping limitations</a> for details.</li>
      <li>SendPlay does not trigger AutoHotkey's hotkeys or hotstrings, or global hotkeys registered by other programs or the OS.</li>

<p>Since SendMode also changes the mode of <a href="Click.htm">Click</a> and <a href="MouseMove.htm">MouseMove</a>/<a href="MouseClick.htm">Click</a>/<a href="MouseClickDrag.htm">Drag</a>, there may be times when you wish to use a different mode for a particular mouse event.

<pre>SendEvent "{Click 100 200}"  <em>; SendEvent uses the older, traditional method of clicking.</em></pre>
<p>If SendMode is used during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>, it also affects <a href="../misc/Remap.htm">keyboard and mouse remapping</a>. In particular, if you use <code>SendMode "Play"</code> with remapping, see <a href="../misc/Remap.htm#SendPlay">SendPlay remapping limitations</a>.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_SendMode</strong> contains the current setting.</p>

    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>

<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>This function returns the previous setting.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A short delay (sleep) is done automatically after every Control function that changes a control. This is done to improve the reliability of scripts because a control sometimes needs a period of "rest" after being changed by one of these functions. The rest period allows it to update itself and respond to the next function that the script may attempt to send to it.</p>
<p>Specifically, SetControlDelay affects the following functions: <a href="ControlAddItem.htm">ControlAddItem</a>, <a href="ControlChooseIndex.htm">ControlChooseIndex</a>, <a href="ControlChooseString.htm">ControlChooseString</a>, <a href="ControlClick.htm">ControlClick</a>, <a href="ControlDeleteItem.htm">ControlDeleteItem</a>, <a href="EditPaste.htm">EditPaste</a>, <a href="ControlFindItem.htm">ControlFindItem</a>, <a href="ControlFocus.htm">ControlFocus</a>, <a href="ControlHide.htm">ControlHide</a>, <a href="ControlHideDropDown.htm">ControlHideDropDown</a>, <a href="ControlMove.htm">ControlMove</a>, <a href="ControlSetChecked.htm">ControlSetChecked</a>, <a href="ControlSetEnabled.htm">ControlSetEnabled</a>, <a href="ControlSetText.htm">ControlSetText</a>, <a href="ControlShow.htm">ControlShow</a>, <a href="ControlShowDropDown.htm">ControlShowDropDown</a>.</p>
<p><a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a> is not affected; it uses <a href="SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a>.</p>
<p>Although a delay of -1 (no delay at all) is allowed, it is recommended that at least 0 be used, to increase confidence that the script will run correctly even when the CPU is under load.</p>
<p>A delay of 0 internally executes a Sleep(0), which yields the remainder of the script's timeslice to any other process that may need it. If there is none, Sleep(0) will not sleep at all.</p>
<p>If the CPU is slow or under load, or if window animation is enabled, higher delay values may be needed.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_ControlDelay</strong> contains the current setting and can also be assigned a new value instead of calling SetControlDelay.</p>
<p>Every newly launched <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> (such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timed</a> subroutine) starts off fresh with the default setting for this function.

  <dt>Delay</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>Time in milliseconds. Use -1 for no delay at all and 0 for the smallest possible delay (however, if the <em>Play</em> parameter is present, both 0 and -1 produce no delay). Leave this parameter blank to retain the current <em>Delay</em>.</p>
    <p>If SetKeyDelay is never used by a script, the default <em>Delay</em> for the tradional SendEvent mode is 10. For <a href="Send.htm#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay mode</a>, the default <em>Delay</em> is -1. The default <em>PressDuration</em> (below) is -1 for both modes.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="dur">PressDuration</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>Certain games and other specialized applications may require a delay inside each keystroke; that is, after the press of the key but before its release.</p>
    <p>Use -1 for no delay at all (default) and 0 for the smallest possible delay (however, if the <em>Play</em> parameter is present, both 0 and -1 produce no delay). Omit this parameter to leave the current <em>PressDuration</em> unchanged.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <em>PressDuration</em> also produces a delay after any change to the modifier key state (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, and <kbd>Win</kbd>) needed to support the keys being sent.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Play</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The word <em>Play</em> applies the above settings to the <a href="Send.htm#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay mode</a> rather than the traditional SendEvent mode. If a script never uses this parameter, the delay is always -1/-1 for SendPlay.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> SetKeyDelay is not obeyed by <a href="Send.htm#SendInputDetail">SendInput</a>; there is no delay between keystrokes in that mode. This same is true for <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> when <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode Input</a> is in effect.</p>
<p>A short delay (sleep) is done automatically after every keystroke sent by <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> or <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a>. This is done to improve the reliability of scripts because a window sometimes can't keep up with a rapid flood of keystrokes.</p>
<p>During the delay (sleep), the current thread is made <a href="../misc/Threads.htm#Interrupt">uninterruptible</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the granularity of the OS's time-keeping system, delays might be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10 or 15.</p>
<p>For Send/SendEvent mode, a delay of 0 internally executes a Sleep(0), which yields the remainder of the script's timeslice to any other process that may need it. If there is none, Sleep(0) will not sleep at all. By contrast, a delay of -1 will never sleep.  For better reliability, 0 is recommended as an alternative to -1.</p>
<p>When the delay is set to -1, a script's process-priority becomes an important factor in how fast it can send keystrokes when using the traditional <a href="SendMode.htm">SendEvent mode</a>. To raise a script's priority, use <code><a href="ProcessSetPriority.htm">ProcessSetPriority</a> "High"</code>. Although this typically causes keystrokes to be sent faster than the <a href="WinActivate.htm">active window</a> can process them, the system automatically buffers them. Buffered keystrokes continue to arrive in the target window after the <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> function completes (even if the window is no longer active). This is usually harmless because any subsequent keystrokes sent to the same window get queued up behind the ones already in the buffer.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_KeyDelay</strong> contains the current setting of <em>Delay</em> for Send/SendEvent mode.  <strong>A_KeyDuration</strong> contains the setting for <em>PressDuration</em>, while <strong>A_KeyDelayPlay</strong> and <strong>A_KeyDurationPlay</strong> contain the settings for <a href="Send.htm#SendPlayDetail">SendPlay</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Timers are useful because they run asynchronously, meaning that they will run at the specified frequency (interval) even when the script is  waiting for a window, displaying a dialog, or busy with another task. Examples of their many uses include taking some action when the user becomes idle (as reflected by <a href="../Variables.htm#TimeIdle">A_TimeIdle</a>) or closing unwanted windows the moment they appear.</p>
<p>Although timers may give the illusion that the script is performing more than one task simultaneously, this is not the case. Instead, timed functions are treated just like other threads: they can interrupt or be interrupted by another thread, such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey subroutine</a>. See <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">Threads</a> for details.</p>
<p>Whenever a timer is created or updated with a new <em>period</em>, its function will not be called right away; its time <em>period</em> must expire first. If you wish the timer's first execution to be immediate, call the timer's function directly (however, this will not start a new thread like the timer itself does; so settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> will not start off at their defaults).</p>
<p id="reset"><strong>Reset</strong>: If SetTimer is used on an existing timer, the timer is reset (unless <em>Priority</em> is specified and <em>Period</em> is omitted); in other words, the entirety of its period must elapse before its function will be called again.</p>
<p id="Precision"><strong>Timer precision</strong>: Due to the granularity of the OS's time-keeping system, <em>Period</em> is typically rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10 or 15.6 milliseconds (depending on the type of hardware and drivers installed). A shorter delay may be achieved via Loop+Sleep as demonstrated at <a href="Sleep.htm#ExShorterSleep">DllCall+timeBeginPeriod+Sleep</a>.</p>
<p id="Reliability"><strong>Reliability</strong>: A timer might not be able to run at the expected time under the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Other applications are putting a heavy load on the CPU.</li>
  <li>The timer's function is still running when the timer period expires again.</li>
  <li>There are too many other competing timers.</li>
  <li>The timer has been interrupted by another <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, namely another timed function, <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey subroutine</a>, or <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a> (this can be avoided via <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a>). If this happens and the interrupting thread takes a long time to finish, the interrupted timer will be effectively disabled for the duration. However, any other timers will continue to run by interrupting the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> that interrupted the first timer.</li>
  <li>The script is uninterruptible as a result of <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> or <a href="Thread.htm">Thread "Interrupt/Priority"</a>. During such times, timers will not run. Later, when the script becomes interruptible again, any overdue timer will run once as soon as possible and then resume its normal schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although timers will operate when the script is <a href="Suspend.htm">suspended</a>, they will not run if the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> has <a href="Thread.htm">Thread "NoTimers"</a> in effect or whenever any thread is <a href="Pause.htm">paused</a>. In addition, they do not operate when the user is navigating through one of the script's menus (such as the tray icon menu or a menu bar).</p>
<p>Because timers operate by temporarily interrupting the script's current activity, their functions should be kept short (so that they finish  quickly) whenever a long interruption would be undesirable.</p>
<p id="otherremarks"><strong>Other remarks</strong>: A temporary timer might often be disabled by its own function (see examples at the bottom of this page).</p>
<p>Whenever a function is called by a timer, it starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>. These defaults can be changed during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>.</p>
<p>If <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> response time is crucial (such as in games) and the script contains any timers whose functions take longer than about 5 ms to execute, use the following function to avoid any chance of a 15 ms delay. Such a delay would otherwise happen if a hotkey is pressed at the exact moment a timer thread is in its period of uninterruptibility:</p>
<pre><a href="Thread.htm">Thread</a> "interrupt", 0  <em>; Make all threads always-interruptible.</em></pre>
<p>If a timer is disabled while its function is currently running, that function will continue until it completes.</p>
<p>The <a href="KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a> feature shows how many timers exist and how many are currently enabled.</p>

<p>Tips relating to the above example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We can also use <code>this.timer := this.Tick.<a href="Func.htm#Bind">Bind</a>(this)</code>.  When <code>this.timer</code> is called, it will effectively invoke <code><i>tick_function</i>.<a href="Func.htm#Call">Call</a>(this)</code>, where <i>tick_function</i> is the function object which implements that method. By contrast, <a href="ObjBindMethod.htm">ObjBindMethod</a> produces an object which invokes <code>this.Tick()</code>.</li>
  <li>If we rename <em>Tick</em> to <em>Call</em>, we can just use <code>this</code> directly instead of <code>this.timer</code>.  However, ObjBindMethod is useful when the object has multiple methods which should be called by different event sources, such as hotkeys, menu items, GUI controls, etc.</li>
  <li>If the timer is being modified or deleted from within a function/method called by the timer, it may be easier to <a href="#OmitCallback">omit the <em>Function</em> parameter</a>. In some cases this avoids the need to retain the original object which was passed to SetTimer.</li>

  <dt>MatchMode</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>Specify one of the following digits or the word RegEx:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 = A window's title must start with the specified <em>WinTitle</em> to be a match.</li>
      <li>2 = A window's title can contain <em>WinTitle</em> anywhere inside it to be a match.</li>
      <li>3 = A window's title must exactly match <em>WinTitle</em> to be a match.</li>
      <li id="RegEx">RegEx = Changes <em>WinTitle</em>, <em>WinText</em>, <em>ExcludeTitle</em>, and <em>ExcludeText</em> to accept <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm">regular expressions</a>. For example: <code><a href="WinActivate.htm">WinActivate</a> "Untitled.*Notepad"</code>.
        <p>RegEx also applies to <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_class">ahk_class</a> and <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_exe">ahk_exe</a>; for example, <code>ahk_class IEFrame</code> searches for any window whose class name contains <em>IEFrame</em> anywhere (this is because by default, regular expressions find a match <em>anywhere</em> in the target string).</p>
        <p>For <em>WinTitle</em>, each component is separate. For example, in <code>"i)^untitled ahk_class i)^notepad$ ahk_pid " mypid</code>, <code>"i)^untitled"</code> and <code>"i)^notepad$"</code> are separate regex patterns and <code>mypid</code> is always compared numerically (it is not a regex pattern).</p>
        <p>For <em>WinText</em>, each text element (i.e. each control's text) is matched against the RegEx separately. Therefore, it is not possible to have a match span more than one text element.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The modes above also affect <em>ExcludeTitle</em> in the same way as <em>WinTitle</em>. For example, mode 3 requires that a window's title exactly match <em>ExcludeTitle</em> for that window to be excluded.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Speed</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>One of the following words to specify how the <em>WinText</em> and <em>ExcludeText</em> parameters should be matched:</p>
    <p><strong>Fast</strong>: This is the default behavior. Performance may be substantially better than <em>Slow</em>, but certain types of controls are not detected. For instance, text is typically detected within Static and Button controls, but not Edit controls, unless they are owned by the script.</p>
    <p><strong>Slow</strong>: Can be much slower, but works with all controls which respond to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winmsg/wm-gettext">WM_GETTEXT</a> message.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>This function returns the previous value of whichever setting was changed (either <a href="../Variables.htm#TitleMatchMode">A_TitleMatchMode</a> or <a href="../Variables.htm#TitleMatchModeSpeed">A_TitleMatchModeSpeed</a>).</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This function affects the behavior of all windowing functions, e.g. <a href="WinExist.htm">WinExist</a> and <a href="WinActivate.htm">WinActivate</a>. <a href="WinGetText.htm">WinGetText</a> is affected in the same way as other functions, but it always uses the <em>Slow</em> method to retrieve text.</p>
<p>If unspecified, TitleMatchMode defaults to 2 and <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>If a <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_group">window group</a> is used, the current title match mode applies to each individual rule in the group.</p>
<p>Generally, the <em>slow</em> mode should be used only if the  target window cannot be uniquely identified by its title and <em>fast</em>-mode text. This is because the slow mode can be extremely slow if there are any application windows that are busy or "not responding".</p>
<p>Window Spy has an option for <em>Slow TitleMatchMode</em> so that its easy to determine whether the <em>Slow</em> mode is needed.</p>
<p>If you wish to change both attributes, run the function twice as in this example:</p>
<pre>SetTitleMatchMode 2
SetTitleMatchMode "slow"</pre>
<p>The built-in variables <strong>A_TitleMatchMode</strong> and <strong>A_TitleMatchModeSpeed</strong> contain the current settings.</p>
<p>Regardless of the current TitleMatchMode, <em>WinTitle</em>, <em>WinText</em>, <em>ExcludeTitle</em> and <em>ExcludeText</em> are case sensitive. The only exception is the <a href="../misc/RegEx-QuickRef.htm#Options">case-insensitive option</a> of the RegEx mode; for example: <code><strong>i)</strong>untitled - notepad</code>.</p>
<p>Every newly launched <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> (such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timed</a> subroutine) starts off fresh with the default setting for this function.

<p>A short delay (sleep) is done automatically after every windowing function except <a href="WinActive.htm">WinActive</a> and <a href="WinExist.htm">WinExist</a>. This is done to improve the reliability of scripts because a window sometimes needs a period of "rest" after being created,  activated, minimized, etc. so that it has a chance to update itself and respond to the next function that the script may attempt to send to it.</p>
<p>Although a delay of -1 (no delay at all) is allowed, it is recommended that at least 0 be used, to increase confidence that the script will run correctly even when the CPU is under load.</p>
<p>A delay of 0 internally executes a Sleep(0), which yields the remainder of the script's timeslice to any other process that may need it. If there is none, Sleep(0) will not sleep at all.</p>
<p>If the CPU is slow or under load, or if window animation is enabled, higher delay values may be needed.</p>

<dl>

  <dt>Delay</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The amount of time to pause (in milliseconds) between 0 and 2147483647 (24 days).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Due to the granularity of the OS's time-keeping system, <em>Delay</em> is typically rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10 or 15.6 milliseconds (depending on the type of hardware and drivers installed). To achieve a shorter delay, see <a href="#ExShorterSleep">Examples</a>.</p>
<p>The actual delay time might wind up being longer than what was requested if the CPU is under load. This is because the OS gives each needy process a slice of CPU time (typically 20 milliseconds) before giving another timeslice to the script.</p>
<p>A delay of 0 yields the remainder of the script's current timeslice to any other processes that need it (as long as they are not significantly lower in <a href="ProcessSetPriority.htm">priority</a> than the script). Thus, a delay of 0 produces an actual delay between 0 and 20ms (or more), depending on the number of needy processes (if there are no needy processes, there will be no delay at all). However, a <em>Delay</em> of 0 should always wind up being shorter than any longer <em>Delay</em> would have been.</p>
<p>While sleeping, new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> can be launched via <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep -1</strong>: A delay of -1 does not sleep but instead makes the script immediately check its message queue. This can be used to force any pending <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">interruptions</a> to occur at a specific place rather than somewhere more random. See <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>This function returns the sorted version of the specified string.</p>

<h2 id="Options">Options</h2>
<p><u>A string of zero or more of the following letters (in any order, with optional spaces in between):</u></p>
<p><strong>C</strong>, <strong>C1</strong> or <strong>COn</strong>: Case sensitive sort (ignored if the <strong>N</strong> option is also present).</p>
<p><strong>C0</strong> or <strong>COff</strong>: Case insensitive sort. The uppercase letters A-Z are considered identical to their lowercase counterparts for the purpose of the sort. This is the default mode if none of the other case sensitivity options are used.</p>
<p><strong>CL</strong> or <strong>CLocale</strong>: Case insensitive sort based on the current user's locale. For example, most English and Western European locales treat the letters A-Z and ANSI letters like &Auml; and &Uuml; as identical to their lowercase counterparts. This method also uses a "word sort", which treats hyphens and apostrophes in such a way that words like "coop" and "co-op" stay together. Depending on the content of the items being sorted, the performance will be 1 to 8 times worse than the default method of insensitivity.</p>
<p><strong>CLogical</strong>: Like <em>CLocale</em>, but digits in the strings are considered as numerical content rather than text. For example, "A2" is considered less than "A10". However, if two numbers differ only by the presence of a leading zero, the string with leading zero may be considered <em>less</em> than the other string. The exact behavior may differ between OS versions.</p>
<p><strong>Dx</strong>: Specifies <strong>x</strong> as the delimiter character, which determines where each item begins and ends. The delimiter is always case-sensitive. If this option is not present, <strong>x</strong> defaults to linefeed (`n). In most cases this will work even if lines end with CR+LF (`r`n), but the carriage return (`r) is included in comparisons and therefore affects the sort order. For example, <code>B`r`nA</code> will sort as expected, but <code>A`r`nA`t`r`nB</code> will place <code>A`t`r</code> before <code>A`r</code>.</p>
<p><strong>N</strong>: Numeric sort: Each item is assumed to be a number rather than a string (for example, if this option is not present, the string 233 is considered to be less than the string 40 due to alphabetical ordering). Both decimal and hexadecimal strings (e.g. 0xF1) are considered to be numeric. Strings that do not start with a number are considered to be zero for the purpose of the sort. Numbers are treated as 64-bit floating point values so that the decimal portion of each number (if any) is taken into account.</p>
<p><strong>Pn</strong>: Sorts items based on character position <strong>n</strong> (do not use hexadecimal for <strong>n</strong>). If this option is not present, <strong>n</strong> defaults to 1, which is the position of the first character. The sort compares each string to the others starting at its <strong>n</strong>th character. If <strong>n</strong> is greater than the length of any string, that string is considered to be blank for the purpose of the sort. When used with option <strong>N</strong> (numeric sort), the string's character position is used, which is not necessarily the same as the number's digit position.</p>
<p><strong>R</strong>: Sorts in reverse order (alphabetically or numerically depending on the other options).</p>
<p><strong>Random</strong>: Sorts in random order. This option causes all other options except <strong>D</strong>, <strong>Z</strong>, and <strong>U</strong> to be ignored (though <strong>N</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>CL</strong> still affect how duplicates are detected). Examples:</p>
<pre>MyVar := Sort(MyVar, "Random")
MyVar := Sort(MyVar, "Random Z D|")</pre>
<p id="unique"><strong>U</strong>: Removes duplicate items from the list so that every item is unique. If the <strong>C</strong> option is in effect, the case of items must match for them to be considered identical. If the <strong>N</strong> option is in effect, an item such as 2 would be considered a duplicate of 2.0. If either the <strong>Pn</strong> or <strong>\</strong> (backslash) option is in effect, the entire item must be a duplicate, not just the substring that is used for sorting. If the <strong>Random</strong> option or <a href="#callback">custom sorting</a> is in effect, duplicates are removed only if they appear adjacent to each other as a result of the sort. For example, when "A|B|A" is sorted randomly, the result could contain either one or two A's.</p>
<p><strong>Z</strong>: To understand this option, consider a variable that contains RED`nGREEN`nBLUE`n. If the <strong>Z</strong> option is not present, the last linefeed (`n) is considered to be part of the last item, and thus there are only 3 items. But by specifying <strong>Z</strong>, the last `n (if present) will be considered to delimit a blank item at the end of the list, and thus there are 4 items (the last being blank).</p>
<p><strong>\</strong>: Sorts items based on the substring that follows the last backslash in each. If an item has no backslash, the entire item is used as the substring. This option is useful for sorting bare filenames (i.e. excluding their paths), such as the example below, in which the AAA.txt line is sorted above the BBB.txt line because their directories are ignored for the purpose of the sort:</p>
<pre>C:\BBB\AAA.txt
C:\AAA\BBB.txt</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Options <strong>N</strong> and <strong>P</strong> are ignored when the backslash option is present.</p>

<h2 id="callback">Custom Sorting</h2>
<p>Custom sorting is achieved by providing the <em>Function</em> parameter with a <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a> or <a href="../misc/Functor.htm">function object</a> which compares any two items in the list. The function must accept two or three parameters:</p>
<pre class="Syntax">MyFunction(first, second <span class="optional">, offset</span>)</pre>
<p>When the function deems the first parameter to be greater than the second, it should return a positive integer; when it deems the two parameters to be equal, it should return 0, "", or nothing; otherwise, it should return a negative integer. If a decimal point is present in the returned value, that part is ignored (i.e. 0.8 is the same as 0).</p>
<p>If present, the third parameter receives the offset (in characters) of the second item from the first as seen in the original/unsorted list (see examples).</p>
<p>The function uses the same global (or thread-specific) settings as the Sort function that called it.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: All options except <strong>D</strong>, <strong>Z</strong>, and <strong>U</strong> are ignored when a <em>Function</em> is present (though <strong>N</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>CL</strong> still affect how <a href="#unique">duplicates</a> are detected).</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This function is typically used to sort a variable that contains a list of lines, with each line ending in a linefeed character (`n). One way to get a list of lines into a variable is to load an entire file via <a href="FileRead.htm">FileRead</a>.</p>
<p>If a large variable was sorted and later its contents are no longer needed, you can free its memory by making it blank, e.g. <code>MyVar := ""</code>.</p>

<h1>Sound Functions</h1>

<p>Applies to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="SoundGetVolume.htm">SoundGetVolume</a> / <a href="SoundSetVolume.htm">SoundSetVolume</a></li>
  <li><a href="SoundGetMute.htm">SoundGetMute</a> / <a href="SoundSetMute.htm">SoundSetMute</a></li>

  <li><a href="SoundBeep.htm">SoundBeep</a></li>
  <li><a href="SoundPlay.htm">SoundPlay</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="devices">Endpoint Devices</h2>
<p>The "devices" referenced by the SoundGet and SoundSet functions are <em>audio endpoint devices</em>. A single device driver or physical device often has multiple endpoints, such as for different types of output or input. For example:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr><th>Name</th><th abbr="Descr">Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Speakers (Example HD Audio)</td><td>The main analog outputs of this device (uses multiple jacks in the case of surround sound).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Digital Output (Example HD Audio)</td><td>An optical or coaxial digital output.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Microphone (Example HD Audio)</td><td>Captures audio through a microphone jack.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Stereo Mix (Example HD Audio)</td><td>Captures whatever audio is being output to the Speakers endpoint.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Device names typically consist of an endpoint name such as "Speakers" followed by the name of the audio driver in parentheses. Scripts may use the full name or just the leading part of the name, such as "Mic" or "Microphone". An audio driver has a fixed name, but endpoint names may be changed by an administrator at any time via the Sound control panel.</p>
<p id="mmsys">Devices are listed in the Sound control panel, which can be opened by running <code>mmsys.cpl</code> from the command line, or via the Run dialog (<kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>) or the <a href="Run.htm">Run</a> function. By default, the control panel only lists devices that are enabled and plugged in (if applicable), but this can be changed via the right-click menu. AutoHotkey detects devices which are not plugged in, but does not detect disabled devices.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>Components are as shown on the Levels tab of the sound device's properties dialog.</p>
<img src="../static/sound_levels.png" alt="Levels" />
<p>In this example, the master controls are at the top, followed by the first four components: Microphone, FrontMic, Line In, and Side. All have volume and mute controls, except the fourth component, which only has volume.</p>
<p>A sound device's properties dialog can be opened via the <a href="#mmsys">Sound control panel</a>.</p>
<p>Audio drivers are capable of exposing other controls, such as bass and treble. However, common audio drivers tend to have only volume and mute controls, or no components at all. Volume and mute controls are supported directly through <a href="SoundGetVolume.htm">SoundGetVolume</a>, <a href="SoundSetVolume.htm">SoundSetVolume</a>, <a href="SoundGetMute.htm">SoundGetMute</a> and <a href="SoundSetMute.htm">SoundSetMute</a>. All other controls are supported only indirectly, through <a href="SoundGetInterface.htm">SoundGetInterface</a> and <a href="ComCall.htm">ComCall</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Advanced_Details">Advanced Details</h3>
<p>Components are discovered through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/coreaudio/devicetopology-api">DeviceTopology API</a>, which exposes a graph of <em>Connectors</em> and <em>Subunits</em>. Each component shown above has a Connector, and it is the Connector that defines the component's name. Each control (such as volume or mute) is represented by a Subunit which sits between the Connector and the endpoint. Data "flows" from or to the Connector and is altered as it flows through each Subunit, such as to adjust volume or suppress (mute) all sound.</p>
<p>The SoundGet and SoundSet functions identify components by walking the <em>device topology</em> graph and counting Connectors with the given name (or all Connectors if no name is given). Once the matching Connector is found, a control interface (such as IAudioVolumeLevel or IAudioMute) is retrieved by querying each Subunit on that specific branch of the graph, starting nearest the Connector.</p>
<p>Subunits which apply to multiple Connectors are excluded - such as Subunits which correspond to the master volume and mute controls. A Connector is counted if (and only if) it has at least one Subunit of its own, even if the Subunit is not of the requested type.</p>
<p>In practice, the end result is that the available components are as listed on <a href="#components">the Levels tab</a>, and in the same order. However, this process is based on observation, trial and error, so might not be 100% accurate.</p>

      <li>As above, but followed by a colon and integer, where 1 is the first occurrence of a component with that name.

    </ul>
    <p>If only an index is specified, the display names are ignored. For example, <code>1</code>, <code>"1"</code> and <code>":1"</code> use the first component regardless of name, whereas <code>""</code> uses the master controls.</p>

<p>If a file is playing and the current script plays a second file, the first file will be stopped so that the second one can play. On some systems, certain file types might stop playing even when an entirely separate script plays a new file.</p>
<p>To stop a file that is currently playing, use SoundPlay on a nonexistent filename as in this example: <code>try SoundPlay "Nonexistent.avi"</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Path</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The file name or URL to be analyzed.</p>
    <p>Note that this function expects filename paths to contain backslashes (\) only and URLs to contain forward slashes (/) only.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>&amp;OutFileName</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a></p>
    <p>A reference to the output variable in which to store the file name without its path. The file's extension is included.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>&amp;OutDir</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a></p>
    <p>A reference to the output variable in which to store the directory of the file, including drive letter or share name (if present). The final backslash is not included even if the file is located in a drive's root directory.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>&amp;OutExtension</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a></p>
    <p>A reference to the output variable in which to store the file's extension (e.g. TXT, DOC, or EXE). The dot is not included.</p>

  <dt>&amp;OutNameNoExt</dt>
  <dd>

    <p>A reference to the output variable in which to store the drive letter or server name of the file. If the file is on a local or mapped drive, the variable will be set to the drive letter followed by a colon (no backslash). If the file is on a network path (UNC), the variable will be set to the share name, e.g. \\Workstation01</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Any of the output variables may be omitted if the corresponding information is not needed.</p>
<p>If <em>Path</em> contains a filename that lacks a drive letter (that is, it has no path or merely a relative path), <em>OutDrive</em> will be made blank but all the other output variables will be set correctly. Similarly, if there is no path present, <em>OutDir</em> will be made blank; and if there is a path but no file name present, <em>OutFileName</em> and <em>OutNameNoExt</em> will be made blank.</p>
<p>Actual files and directories in the file system are not checked by this function. It simply analyzes the provided string.</p>
<p>Wildcards (* and ?) and other  characters illegal in filenames are  treated the same as legal characters, with the exception of colon, backslash, and period (dot), which are processed according to their nature in delimiting the drive letter, directory, and extension of the file.</p>
<p><strong>Support for URLs</strong>: If <em>Path</em> contains a colon-double-slash, such as https://domain.com or ftp://domain.com, <em>OutDir</em> is set to the protocol prefix + domain name + directory (e.g. https://domain.com/images) and <em>OutDrive</em> is set to the protocol prefix + domain name (e.g. https://domain.com). All other variables are set according to their definitions above.</p>

<h1>StrCompare</h1>
<p>Compares two strings alphabetically.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Result := <span class="func">StrCompare</span>(String1, String2 <span class="optional">, CaseSense</span>)</pre>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>String1, String2</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The strings to be compared.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CaseSense</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>One of the following values (defaults to 0 if omitted):</p>
    <p><code>"On"</code> or <code>1</code> (<code>True</code>): The comparison is case sensitive.</p>
    <p><code>"Off"</code> or <code>0</code> (<code>False</code>): The letters A-Z are considered identical to their lowercase counterparts.</p>
    <p id="Locale"><code>"Locale"</code>: The comparison is case insensitive according to the rules of the current user's locale. For example, most English and Western European locales treat not only the letters A-Z as identical to their lowercase counterparts, but also non-ASCII letters like &Auml; and &Uuml; as identical to theirs. <em>Locale</em> is 1 to 8 times slower than <em>Off</em> depending on the nature of the strings being compared.</p>
    <p id="Logical"><code>"Logical"</code>: Like <em>Locale</em>, but digits in the strings are considered as numerical content rather than text. For example, "A2" is considered less than "A10". However, if two numbers differ only by the presence of a leading zero, the string with leading zero may be considered <em>less</em> than the other string. The exact behavior may differ between OS versions.</p>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>To indicate the relationship between <em>String1</em> and <em>String2</em>, this function returns one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0, if <em>String1</em> is identical to <em>String2</em></li>
  <li>a positive integer, if <em>String1</em> is greater than <em>String2</em></li>
  <li>a negative integer, if <em>String1</em> is less than <em>String2</em></li>
</ul>
<p>To check for a specific relationship between the two strings, compare the result to 0. For example:</p>
<pre>a_less_than_b := StrCompare(a, b) &lt; 0
a_greater_than_or_equal_to_b := StrCompare(a, b) &gt;= 0</pre>

    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#objects">Object</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>A <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a>-like object containing the string, or the memory address of the string.</p>
    <p>Any object which implements <a href="Buffer.htm#Ptr">Ptr</a> and <a href="Buffer.htm#Size">Size</a> properties may be used, but this function is optimized for the native <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a> object. Passing an object with these properties ensures that the function does not read memory from an invalid location; doing so could cause crashes or other unpredictable behaviour.</p>
    <p>The string is not required to be <a href="../Concepts.htm#null-termination">null-terminated</a> if a Buffer-like object is provided, or if the <em>Length</em> parameter is specified.</p>

    <p>The maximum number of <a href="../Concepts.htm#character">characters</a> to read. This can be omitted if the string is <a href="../Concepts.htm#null-termination">null-terminated</a>.</p>
    <p>By default, StrGet only copies up to the first binary zero. If <em>Length</em> is negative, its absolute value indicates the exact number of characters to convert, including any binary zeros that the string might contain - in other words, the result is always a string of exactly that length.</p>
    <p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Omitting <em>Length</em> when the string is not null-terminated may cause an access violation which terminates the program, or some other undesired result. Specifying an incorrect length may produce unexpected behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Note that the return value is always in the <a href="../Concepts.htm#string-encoding">native encoding</a> of the current executable, whereas <i>Encoding</i> specifies how to interpret the string read from the given <i>Source</i>. If no <em>Encoding</em> is specified, the string is simply copied without any conversion taking place.</p>
<p class="note">In other words, StrGet is used to retrieve text from a memory address or buffer, or convert it to a format the script can understand.</p>
<p>If conversion between code pages is necessary, the length of the return value may differ from the length of the source string.</p>

<h1>StrPtr</h1>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>This function returns the current memory address of <em>Value</em>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The lifetime of an address and which operations are valid to perform on it depend on how <em>Value</em> was passed to this function. There are three distinct cases, shown as example code below. In all cases, if the string will <strong>not</strong> be modified, the return value can be passed <em>directly</em> to a <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> function or <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>.</p>
<pre>Ptr := StrPtr(MyVar)</pre>
<p>If <em>Value</em> is a variable reference such as <code>MyVar</code> (and not a built-in variable), the return value is the memory address of the variable's internal string buffer. <code><a href="VarSetStrCapacity.htm">VarSetStrCapacity</a>(&amp;MyVar)</code> returns the size of the buffer <strong>in characters</strong>, excluding the terminating null character.</p>
<p>The address should be considered valid <em>only</em> until the variable is freed or has been reassigned by means of any of the <a href="../Variables.htm#AssignOp">assignment operators</a> or by passing it to a built-in function. The address of the contents of a function's <a href="../Functions.htm#Local">local</a> variable is not valid after the function returns, as local variables are freed automatically.</p>
<p>The address can be stored in a <a href="DllCall.htm#struct">structure</a> or another variable, and passed indirectly to <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> or <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> or used in other ways, for as long as it remains valid as described above.</p>
<p>The script may change the value of the string indirectly by passing the address to <a href="NumPut.htm">NumPut</a>, <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> or <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>. If the length of the string is changed this way, the variable's internal length property must be updated by calling <code><a href="VarSetStrCapacity.htm">VarSetStrCapacity</a>(MyVar, -1)</code>.</p>
<pre>Ptr := StrPtr("literal string")</pre>
<p>The address of a literal string is valid until the program exits. The script should not attempt to modify the string. The address can be stored in a <a href="DllCall.htm#struct">structure</a> or another variable, and passed indirectly to <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> or <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> or used in other ways.</p>
<pre>SendMessage 0x000C, 0, StrPtr(A_ScriptName " changed this title"),, "A"</pre>
<p>The address of a temporary string is valid only until evaluation of the overall expression or function call statement is completed, after which time it must not be used. For the example above, the address is valid until SendMessage returns. All of the following yield temporary strings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Concatenation.</li>
  <li>Built-in variables such as <a href="../Variables.htm#ScriptName">A_ScriptName</a>.</li>
  <li>Functions which return strings.</li>
  <li>Accessing properties of an object, array elements or map elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>If not explicitly covered above, it is safe to assume the string is temporary.</p>

    <p><code>"On"</code> or <code>1</code> (<code>True</code>): The search is case sensitive.</p>
    <p><code>"Off"</code> or <code>0</code> (<code>False</code>): The letters A-Z are considered identical to their lowercase counterparts.</p>
    <p><code>"Locale"</code>: The search is case insensitive according to the rules of the current user's locale. For example, most English and Western European locales treat not only the letters A-Z as identical to their lowercase counterparts, but also non-ASCII letters like &Auml; and &Uuml; as identical to theirs. <em>Locale</em> is 1 to 8 times slower than <em>Off</em> depending on the nature of the strings being compared.</p>

<h1>StrSplit</h1>
<p>Separates a string into an array of substrings using the specified delimiters.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Array := <span class="func">StrSplit</span>(String <span class="optional">, Delimiters, OmitChars, MaxParts</span>)</pre>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>String</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>A string to split.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Delimiters</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a> or <a href="Array.htm">Array</a> of <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">Strings</a></p>
    <p>If this parameter is blank or omitted, each character of the input string will be treated as a separate substring.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, <em>Delimiters</em> can be either a single string or an array of strings, each of which is used to determine where the boundaries between substrings occur. Since the delimiters are not considered to be part of the substrings themselves, they are never included in the returned array. Also, if there is nothing between a pair of delimiters within the input string, the corresponding array element will be blank.</p>
    <p>For example: <code>","</code> would divide the string based on every occurrence of a comma. Similarly, <code>[A_Tab, A_Space]</code> would create a new array element every time a space or tab is encountered in the input string.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>OmitChars</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>An optional list of characters (case sensitive) to exclude from the beginning and end of each array element. For example, if <em>OmitChars</em> is <code>" `t"</code>, spaces and tabs will be removed from the beginning and end (but not the middle) of every element.</p>
    <p>If <em>Delimiters</em> is blank, <em>OmitChars</em> indicates which characters should be excluded from the array.</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>MaxParts</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If omitted, it defaults to -1, which means "no limit". Otherwise, specify the maximum number of substrings to return. If non-zero, the string is split a maximum of <em>MaxParts</em>-1 times and the remainder of the string is returned in the last substring (excluding any leading or trailing <em>OmitChars</em>).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#objects">Array</a> of <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">Strings</a></p>
<p>This function returns an <a href="../Objects.htm#Usage_Simple_Arrays">array</a> containing the substrings of the specified string.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Whitespace characters such as spaces and tabs will be preserved unless those characters are included in the <em>Delimiters</em> or <em>OmitChars</em> parameters. Tabs and spaces can be trimmed from both ends of any variable by using <a href="Trim.htm">Trim</a>. For example: <code>Var := Trim(Var)</code></p>
<p>To split a string that is in standard CSV (comma separated value) format, use a <a href="LoopParse.htm">parsing loop</a> since it has  built-in CSV handling.</p>
<p>To arrange the fields in a different order prior to splitting them, use the <a href="Sort.htm">Sort</a> function.</p>
<p>If you do not need the substrings to be permanently stored in memory, consider using a <a href="LoopParse.htm">parsing loop</a> -- especially if <em>String</em> is very large, in which case a large amount of memory would be saved. For example:</p>
<pre>Colors := "red,green,blue"
Loop Parse, Colors, ","
    MsgBox "Color number " A_Index " is " A_LoopField</pre>

    <p>Specify a negative <em>StartingPos</em> to start at that position from the right.

    <p>One of the following values:</p>
    <p><code>1</code> or <code>True</code>: Suspends all <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> and <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a> except those explained the Remarks section.</p>
    <p><code>0</code> or <code>False</code>: Re-enables the hotkeys and hotstrings that were disable above.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>By default, the script can also be suspended via its <a href="../Program.htm#tray-icon">tray icon</a> or <a href="../Program.htm#main-window">main window</a>.</p>
<p>A hotkey/hotstring can be made exempt from suspension by preceding it with the <a href="_SuspendExempt.htm">#SuspendExempt</a> directive. An exempt hotkey/hotstring will remain enabled even while suspension is ON. This allows suspension to be turned off via a hotkey, which would otherwise be impossible since the hotkey would be suspended.</p>
<p>The <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard</a> and/or <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse</a> hooks will be installed or removed if justified by the changes made by this function.</p>
<p>To disable selected hotkeys or hotstrings automatically based on any condition, such as the type of window that is active, use <a href="_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a>.</p>
<p>Suspending a script's hotkeys does not stop the script's already-running <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> (if any); use <a href="Pause.htm">Pause</a> to do that.</p>
<p>When a script's hotkeys are suspended, its tray icon changes to the letter S. This can be avoided by freezing the icon, which is done by specifying 1 for the last parameter of the TraySetIcon function. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="TraySetIcon.htm">TraySetIcon</a> ,, 1</pre>
<p>The built-in variable <a href="../Variables.htm#IsSuspended">A_IsSuspended</a> contains 1 if the script is suspended and 0 otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>If present, <em>SwitchValue</em> is evaluated once and compared to each case value until a match is found, and then that case is executed. Otherwise, the first case which evaluates to <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">true</a> (non-zero and non-empty) is executed. If there is no matching case and a <code>Default</code> is present, it is executed.</p>
<p>As with the <code>=</code> and <code>==</code> operators, when <em>CaseSense</em> is omitted, numeric comparison is performed if <em>SwitchValue</em> and the case value are both pure numbers, or if one is a pure number and the other is a numeric string. Each case value is considered separately and does not affect the type of comparison used for other case values.</p>
<p>If the <em>CaseSense</em> parameter is present, all values are compared as strings, not as numbers, and a <a href="Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a> is thrown if <em>SwitchValue</em> or a <em>CaseValue</em> evaluates to an object.</p>
<p>If the <em>CaseSense</em> parameter is omitted, string comparisons are case-sensitive by default.</p>
<p>Each case may list up to 20 values. Each value must be an <a href="../Language.htm#expressions">expression</a>, but can be a simple one such as a literal number, quoted string or variable. <code>Case</code> and <code>Default</code> must be terminated with a colon <code>:</code>.</p>
<p>The first statement of each case may be below <code>Case</code> or on the same line, following the colon. Each case implicitly ends at the next <code>Case</code>/<code>Default</code> or the closing brace. Unlike the switch statement found in some other languages, there is no implicit fall-through and <a href="Break.htm">Break</a> is not used (except to break out of an enclosing loop).</p>
<p>As all cases are enclosed in the same block, a label defined in one case can be the target of <a href="Goto.htm">Goto</a> from another case. However, if a label is placed immediately above <code>Case</code> or <code>Default</code>, it targets the end of the previous case, not the beginning of the next one.</p>
<p><code>Default</code> is not required to be listed last.</p>

<h1>Thread</h1>

<p>Sets the priority or interruptibility of <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a>. It can also temporarily disable all <a href="SetTimer.htm">timers</a>.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Thread</span> <a href="#SubFunctions">SubFunction</a> <span class="optional">, Value1, Value2</span></pre>
<p>The <em>SubFunction</em>, <em>Value1</em>, and <em>Value2</em> parameters are dependent upon each other and their usage is described below.</p>

<h2 id="SubFunctions">Sub-functions</h2>
<p>For <em>SubFunction</em>, specify one of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#NoTimers">NoTimers</a>: Prevents interruptions from any timers.</li>
    <li><a href="#Priority">Priority</a>: Changes the priority level of the current thread.</li>
    <li><a href="#Interrupt">Interrupt</a>: Changes the duration of interruptibility for newly launched threads.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="NoTimers">NoTimers</h3>
<p>Prevents interruptions from any timers.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Thread</span> "NoTimers" <span class="optional">, TrueOrFalse</span></pre>
<p>This sub-function prevents interruptions from any <a href="SetTimer.htm">timers</a> until the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> either ends, executes <code>Thread "NoTimers", false</code>, or is interrupted by another thread that allows timers (in which case timers can interrupt the interrupting thread until it finishes).</p>
<p>If this setting is not changed by <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">the auto-execute thread</a>, all threads start off as interruptible by timers (though the settings of the <a href="#Interrupt">Interrupt</a> sub-function [below] will still apply). By contrast, if the auto-execute thread turns on this setting but never turns it off, every newly launched <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> (such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a>) starts off immune to interruptions by timers.</p>
<p>Regardless of the default setting, timers will always operate when the script has no threads (unless <a href="Pause.htm">Pause</a> has been turned on).</p>
<p><code>Thread "NoTimers"</code> is equivalent to <code>Thread "NoTimers", true</code>. In addition, since <em>TrueOrFalse</em> is an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>, true resolves to 1, and false to 0.</p>

<h3 id="Priority">Priority</h3>
<p>Changes the priority level of the current thread.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Thread</span> "Priority", Level</pre>
<p>Specify for <em>Level</em> an integer between -2147483648 and 2147483647 (or an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>) to indicate the current thread's new priority. This has no effect on other threads. See <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">Threads</a> for details.</p>
<p>Due to its ability to buffer events, the function <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> is generally superior to this sub-function.</p>
<p>On a related note, the OS's priority level for the entire script can be changed via <a href="ProcessSetPriority.htm">ProcessSetPriority</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>ProcessSetPriority "High"</pre>

<h3 id="Interrupt">Interrupt</h3>
<p>Changes the duration of interruptibility for newly launched threads.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Thread</span> "Interrupt" <span class="optional">, Duration, LineCount</span></pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This sub-function should be used sparingly because most scripts perform more consistently with settings close to the defaults.</p>
<p>By default, every newly launched thread is uninterruptible for a <em>Duration</em> of 15 milliseconds or a <em>LineCount</em> of 1000 script lines, whichever comes first. This gives the thread a chance to finish rather than  being immediately interrupted by another thread that is waiting to launch (such as a buffered <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> or a series of <a href="SetTimer.htm">timed subroutines</a> that are all due to be run).</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Any <em>Duration</em> less than 17 might result in a shorter actual duration or immediate interruption, since the system tick count has a minimum resolution of 10 to 16 milliseconds. However, at least one line will execute before the thread becomes interruptible, allowing the script to enable <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a>, if needed.</p>
<p>If either parameter is 0, each newly launched thread is immediately interruptible. If either parameter is -1, the thread cannot be interrupted as a result of that parameter. The maximum for both parameters is 2147483647.</p>
<p>This setting is global, meaning that it affects all subsequent threads, even if this function was not called by <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">the auto-execute thread</a>. However, <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">interrupted threads</a> are unaffected because their period of uninterruptibility has already expired. Similarly, the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> is unaffected except if it is uninterruptible at the time the <em>LineCount</em> parameter is changed, in which case the new <em>LineCount</em> will be in effect for it.</p>
<p>If a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> is pressed or a <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a> is selected while the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> is uninterruptible, that event will be buffered. In other words, it will launch when the current thread finishes or becomes interruptible, whichever comes first. The exception to this is when the current thread becomes interruptible before it finishes, and it is of higher <a href="#Priority">priority</a> than the buffered event; in this case the buffered event is unbuffered and discarded.</p>
<p>Regardless of this sub-function, a thread will become interruptible the moment it displays a <a href="MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a>, <a href="InputBox.htm">InputBox</a>, <a href="FileSelect.htm">FileSelect</a>, or <a href="DirSelect.htm">DirSelect</a> dialog.</p>
<p>Either parameter can be left blank to avoid changing it.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Due to its greater flexibility and its ability to buffer events, the function <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> is generally more useful than <code>Thread "Interrupt"</code> and <code>Thread "Priority"</code>.</p>

<h1>Throw</h1>

<p>Signals the occurrence of an error. This signal can be caught by a <a href="Try.htm">try</a>-<a href="Catch.htm">catch</a> statement.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Throw</span> <span class="optional">Value</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Value</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A value to throw; typically an <a href="Error.htm">Error</a> object. For example:</p>
      <pre>throw ValueError("Parameter #1 invalid", -1, theBadParam)</pre>
      <p>Values of all kinds can be thrown, but if <a href="Catch.htm">Catch</a> is used without specifying a class (or <a href="Try.htm">Try</a> is used without <a href="Catch.htm">Catch</a> or <a href="Finally.htm">Finally</a>), it will only catch instances of the <a href="Error.htm">Error</a> class.</p>
      <p>While execution is within a <a href="Catch.htm">Catch</a>, <em>Value</em> can be omitted to re-throw the caught value (avoiding the need to specify an output variable just for that purpose). This is supported even within a nested <em>try-finally</em>, but not within a nested <em>try-catch</em>. The line with <code>throw</code> does not need to be physically contained by the <em>catch</em> statement's body; it can be used by a called function.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The space or tab after <code>throw</code> is optional if the expression is enclosed in parentheses, as in <code>throw(Error())</code>.</p>
<p>A thrown value or runtime error can be <em>caught</em> by <a href="Try.htm">Try</a>-<a href="Catch.htm">Catch</a>. In such cases, execution is transferred into the <em>catch</em> statement or to the next statement after the <em>try</em>. If a thrown value is not caught, the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any active <a href="OnError.htm">OnError</a> callbacks are called. Each callback may inspect <em>Value</em> and either suppress or allow further callbacks and default handling.</li>

<h1>ToolTip</h1>

<p>Creates an always-on-top window anywhere on the screen.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">ToolTip</span> <span class="optional">Text, X, Y, WhichToolTip</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Text</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>If blank or omitted, the existing tooltip (if any) will be hidden. Otherwise, this parameter is the text to display in the tooltip. To create a multi-line tooltip, use the linefeed character (`n) in between each line, e.g. Line1`nLine2.</p>
    <p>If <em>Text</em> is long, it can be broken up into several shorter lines by means of a <a href="../Scripts.htm#continuation">continuation section</a>, which might improve readability and maintainability.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>X, Y</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>The X and Y position of the tooltip relative to the active window's client area (use <code><a href="CoordMode.htm">CoordMode</a> "ToolTip"</code> to change to screen coordinates). If the coordinates are omitted, the tooltip will be shown near the mouse cursor.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>WhichToolTip</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>Omit this parameter if you don't need multiple tooltips to appear simultaneously. Otherwise, this is a number between 1 and 20 to indicate which tooltip window to operate upon. If unspecified, that number is 1 (the first).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#nothing">empty string</a></p>
<p>If a tooltip is being shown or updated, this function returns the tooltip window's <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_id">unique ID (HWND)</a>, which can be used to move the tooltip or send <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/controls/bumper-tooltip-control-reference-messages">Tooltip Control Messages</a>.</p>
<p>If <em>Text</em> is omitted or blank, the return value is an empty string.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A tooltip usually looks like this: <img src="../static/dlg_tooltip.png" alt="ToolTip" style="vertical-align: middle" /></p>
<p>If the X &amp; Y coordinates caused the tooltip to run off-screen, or outside the <a href="MonitorGetWorkArea.htm">monitor's working area</a> on Windows 8 or later, it is repositioned to be entirely visible.</p>
<p>The tooltip is displayed until one of the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The script terminates.</li>
  <li>The ToolTip function is executed again with a blank <em>Text</em> parameter.</li>
  <li>The user clicks on the tooltip (this behavior may vary depending on operating system version).</li>
</ul>
<p>A GUI window may be made the owner of a tooltip by means of the <a href="Gui.htm#OwnDialogs">OwnDialogs option</a>. Such a tooltip is automatically destroyed when its owner is destroyed.</p>

    <p>To use an icon group other than the first one in the file, specify its number for <em>IconNumber</em> (if omitted, it defaults to 1).

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Changing the tray icon also changes the icon displayed by <a href="InputBox.htm">InputBox</a> and subsequently-created <a href="Gui.htm">GUI</a> windows. <a href="../Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">Compiled scripts</a> are also affected even if a custom icon was specified at the time of compiling.

<p id="distort">Slight distortion may occur when loading tray icons from file types other than .ICO. This is especially true for 16x16 icons. To prevent this, store the desired tray icon inside a .ICO file.</p>
<p>There are some icons built into the operating system's DLLs and CPLs that might be useful. For example: <code>TraySetIcon "Shell32.dll", 174</code>.</p>
<p>A <a href="../misc/ImageHandles.htm">bitmap or icon handle</a> can be used instead of a filename. For example, <code>TraySetIcon "HBITMAP:" handle</code>.</p>
<p>The built-in variables <strong><a href="../Variables.htm#IconNumber">A_IconNumber</a></strong> and <strong><a href="../Variables.htm#IconFile">A_IconFile</a></strong> contain the number and name (with full path) of the current icon (both are blank if the icon is the default).</p>

<h2 id="To_Hide_the_Window">To Hide the Window</h2>
<p>To hide a TrayTip balloon window, omit both <em>Text</em> and <em>Title</em>. For example:</p>

<p>To hide a Windows 10 toast notification, temporarily remove the tray icon. For example:</p>
<pre>TrayTip "#1", "This is TrayTip #1"
Sleep 3000   <em>; Let it display for 3 seconds.</em>
HideTrayTip
TrayTip "#2", "This is the second notification."
Sleep 3000

<em id="Hide">; Copy this function into your script to use it.</em>
HideTrayTip() {
    TrayTip  <em>; Attempt to hide it the normal way.</em>
    if SubStr(A_OSVersion,1,3) = "10." {
        A_IconHidden := true
        Sleep 200  <em>; It may be necessary to adjust this sleep.</em>
        A_IconHidden := false
    }
}
</pre>
<p>This may not always work, according to at least one report.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>On Windows 10, a TrayTip window usually looks like this:</p>
<img src="../static/dlg_traytip.png" alt="TrayTip" />
<p id="Windows10"><strong>Windows 10</strong> replaces all balloon windows with toast notifications by default (this can be overridden via group policy). Calling TrayTip multiple times will usually cause multiple notifications to be placed in a "queue" instead of each notification replacing the last.</p>
<p>TrayTip has no effect if the script lacks a tray icon (via <a href="_NoTrayIcon.htm">#NoTrayIcon</a> or <code><a href="../Variables.htm#IconHidden">A_IconHidden</a> := true</code>). TrayTip also has no effect if the following REG_DWORD value exists and has been set to 0:</p>
<pre>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced &gt;&gt; EnableBalloonTips</pre>
<p>On a related note, there is a tooltip displayed whenever the user hovers the mouse over the script's tray icon. The contents of this tooltip can be changed via: <code><a href="../Variables.htm#IconTip">A_IconTip</a> := "My New Text"</code>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="Intro">Introduction and Simple Example</h2>
<p>A Tree-View displays a hierarchy of items by indenting child items beneath their parents. The most common example is Explorer's tree of drives and folders.</p>
<p>A TreeView usually looks like this:</p>
<img src="../static/ctrl_treeview.png" alt="TreeView" />
<p>The syntax for creating a TreeView is:</p>
<pre class="Syntax" id="GuiAdd">TV := GuiObj.<span class="func">Add</span>("TreeView", Options)</pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre class="Syntax">TV := GuiObj.<span class="func">AddTreeView</span>(Options)</pre>
<p>Here is a working script that creates and displays a simple hierarchy of items:</p>
<pre>MyGui := Gui()
TV := MyGui.Add("TreeView")
<span class="red">P1</span> := <a href="#Add">TV.Add</a>("First parent")
P1C1 := TV.Add("Parent 1's first child", <span class="red">P1</span>)  <em>; Specify P1 to be this item's parent.</em>
P2 := TV.Add("Second parent")
P2C1 := TV.Add("Parent 2's first child", P2)
P2C2 := TV.Add("Parent 2's second child", P2)
P2C2C1 := TV.Add("Child 2's first child", P2C2)

MyGui.Show  <em>; Show the window and its TreeView.</em></pre>
<h2 id="Options">Options and Styles for the Options Parameter</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Specify the word Background followed immediately by a color name (see <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">color chart</a>) or RGB value (the 0x prefix is optional). Examples: <code>BackgroundSilver</code>, <code>BackgroundFFDD99</code>. If this option is not present, the TreeView initially defaults to the system's default background color. Specifying <code>BackgroundDefault</code> or <code>-Background</code> applies the system's default background color (usually white). For example, a TreeView can be restored to the default color via <code>TV.Opt("+BackgroundDefault")</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Buttons</strong>: Specify <code>-Buttons</code> (minus Buttons) to avoid displaying a plus or minus button to the left of each item that has children.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong>: Text color. Specify the letter C followed immediately by a color name (see <a href="../misc/Colors.htm">color chart</a>) or RGB value (the 0x prefix is optional). Examples: <code>cRed</code>, <code>cFF2211</code>, <code>c0xFF2211</code>, <code>cDefault</code>.</p>
<p id="Checked"><strong>Checked:</strong> Provides a checkbox at the left side of each item. When <a href="#Add">adding</a> an item, specify the word <em>Check</em> in its options to have the box to start off checked instead of unchecked. The user may either click the checkbox or press the spacebar to check or uncheck an item. To discover which items in a TreeView are currently checked, call the <a href="#GetNext">GetNext method</a> or <a href="#Get">Get method</a>.</p>
<p><strong>HScroll</strong>: Specify <code>-HScroll</code> (minus HScroll) to disable horizontal scrolling in the control (in addition, the control will not display any horizontal scroll bar).</p>
<p id="ImageList"><strong>ImageList</strong>: This is the means by which icons are added to a TreeView. Specify the word <em>ImageList</em> followed immediately by the ImageListID returned from a previous call to <a href="ListView.htm#IL_Create">IL_Create</a>. This option has an effect only when creating a TreeView (however, the <a href="#SetImageList">SetImageList method</a> does not have this limitation). Here is a working example:</p>
<pre>MyGui := Gui()
ImageListID := <a href="ListView.htm#IL_Create">IL_Create</a>(10)  <em>; Create an ImageList with initial capacity for 10 icons.</em>
Loop 10  <em>; Load the ImageList with some standard system icons.</em>
    <a href="ListView.htm#IL_Add">IL_Add</a>(ImageListID, "shell32.dll", A_Index)
TV := MyGui.Add("TreeView", "ImageList" . ImageListID)
<a href="#Add">TV.Add</a>("Name of Item", 0, "Icon4")  <em>; Add an item to the TreeView and give it a folder icon.</em>
MyGui.Show</pre>
<p><strong>Lines</strong>: Specify <code>-Lines</code> (minus Lines) to avoid displaying a network of lines connecting parent items to their children. However, removing these lines also prevents the plus/minus buttons from being shown for top-level items.</p>
<p id="ReadOnly"><strong>ReadOnly:</strong> Specify <code>-ReadOnly</code> (minus ReadOnly) to allow editing of the text/name of each item. To edit an item, select it then press <kbd>F2</kbd> (see the <a href="#WantF2">WantF2</a> option below). Alternatively, you can click an item once to select it, wait at least half a second, then click the same item again to edit it. After being edited, an item can be alphabetically repositioned among its siblings via the following example:</p>
<pre>TV := MyGui.Add("TreeView", "-ReadOnly")
TV.OnEvent("ItemEdit", MyTree_Edit)  <em>; Call MyTree_Edit whenever a user has finished editing an item.</em>
<em>; ...</em>
MyTree_Edit(TV, Item)
{
    TV.Modify(TV.GetParent(Item), "Sort")  <em>; This works even if the item has no parent.</em>
}</pre>
<p><strong>R</strong>: Rows of height (upon creation). Specify the letter R followed immediately by the number of rows for which to make room inside the control. For example, <code>R10</code> would make the control 10 items tall.</p>
<p id="WantF2"><strong>WantF2</strong>: Specify <code>-WantF2</code> (minus WantF2) to prevent <kbd>F2</kbd> from <a href="#ReadOnly">editing</a> the currently selected item. This setting is ignored unless <a href="#ReadOnly">-ReadOnly</a> is also in effect.</p>
<p><strong>(Unnamed numeric styles):</strong> Since styles other than the above are rarely used, they do not have names. See the <a href="../misc/Styles.htm#TreeView">TreeView styles table</a> for a list.</p>
<h2 id="BuiltIn">Built-in Methods for TreeViews</h2>
<p>In addition to the <a href="GuiControl.htm">default methods/properties of a GUI control</a>, TreeView controls have the following methods (defined in the Gui.TreeView class).</p>
<p><strong>Item methods:</strong></p>
<ul>

  <li><a href="#Modify">Modify</a>: Modifies the attributes and/or name of an item.</li>
  <li><a href="#Delete">Delete</a>: Deletes the specified item or all items.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Retrieval methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#GetSelection">GetSelection</a>: Returns the selected item's ID number.</li>
  <li><a href="#GetCount">GetCount</a>: Returns the total number of items in the control.</li>
  <li><a href="#GetParent">GetParent</a>: Returns the specified item's parent as an item ID.</li>
  <li><a href="#GetChild">GetChild</a>: Returns the ID number of the specified item's first/top child.</li>
  <li><a href="#GetPrev">GetPrev</a>: Returns the ID number of the sibling above the specified item.</li>
  <li><a href="#GetNext">GetNext</a>: Returns the ID number of the next item below the specified item.</li>
  <li><a href="#GetText">GetText</a>: Retrieves the text/name of the specified item.</li>

      <p>Contains zero or more words from the list below (not case sensitive). Separate each word from the next with a space or tab. To remove an option, precede it with a minus sign. To add an option, a plus sign is permitted but not required.</p>
      <p id="Bold"><strong>Bold</strong>: Displays the item's name in a bold font. To later un-bold the item, use <code>TV.Modify(ItemID, "-Bold")</code>. The word <em>Bold</em> may optionally be followed immediately by a 0 or 1 to indicate the starting state.</p>
      <p id="Check"><strong>Check</strong>: Shows a checkmark to the left of the item (if the TreeView has <a href="#Checked">checkboxes</a>). To later uncheck it, use <code>TV.Modify(ItemID, "-Check")</code>. The word <em>Check</em> may optionally be followed immediately by a 0 or 1 to indicate the starting state. In other words, both <code>"Check"</code> and <code>"Check" <strong>.</strong> VarContainingOne</code> are the same (the period used here is the <a href="../Variables.htm#concat">concatenation operator</a>).</p>
      <p id="Expand"><strong>Expand</strong>: Expands the item to reveal its children (if any). To later collapse the item, use <code>TV.Modify(ItemID, "-Expand")</code>. If there are no children, the <a href="#Modify">Modify method</a> returns 0 instead of the item's ID. By contrast, the <a href="#Add">Add method</a> marks the item as expanded in case children are added to it later. Unlike "Select" (below), expanding an item does not automatically expand its parent. Finally, the word <em>Expand</em> may optionally be followed immediately by a 0 or 1 to indicate the starting state. In other words, both <code>"Expand"</code> and <code>"Expand" <strong>.</strong> VarContainingOne</code> are the same.</p>
      <p><strong>First | Sort | N</strong>: These options apply only to the <a href="#Add">Add method</a>. They specify the new item's position relative to its siblings (a <em>sibling</em> is any other item on the same level). If none of these options is present, the new item is added as the last/bottom sibling. Otherwise, specify <em>First</em> to add the item as the first/top sibling, or specify <em>Sort</em> to insert it among its siblings in alphabetical order. If a plain integer (<strong>N</strong>) is specified, it is assumed to be ID number of the sibling after which to insert the new item (if integer N is the only option present, it does not have to be enclosed in quotes).</p>
      <p><strong>Icon</strong>: Specify the word <em>Icon</em> followed immediately by the number of this item's icon, which is displayed to the left of the item's name. If this option is absent, the first icon in the <a href="#ImageList">ImageList</a> is used. To display a blank icon, specify a number that is larger than the number of icons in the ImageList. If the control lacks an ImageList, no icon is displayed nor is any space reserved for one.</p>
      <p id="Select"><strong>Select</strong>: Selects the item. Since only one item at a time can be selected, any previously selected item is automatically de-selected. In addition, this option reveals the newly selected item by expanding its parent(s), if necessary. To find out the current selection, call the <a href="#GetSelection">GetSelection method</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Sort</strong>: For the <a href="#Modify">Modify method</a>, this option alphabetically sorts the children of the specified item. To instead sort all top-level items, use <code>TV.Modify(0, "Sort")</code>. If there are no children, 0 is returned instead of the ID of the modified item.</p>
      <p><strong>Vis</strong>: Ensures that the item is completely visible by scrolling the TreeView and/or expanding its parent, if necessary.</p>
      <p><strong>VisFirst</strong>: Same as above except that the TreeView is also scrolled so that the item appears at the top, if possible. This option is typically more effective when used with the <a href="#Modify">Modify method</a> than with the <a href="#Add">Add method</a>.</p>

  <p>Note: When adding a large number of items, performance can be improved by using <code>TV.Opt("-Redraw")</code> before adding the items and <code>TV.Opt("+Redraw")</code> afterward. See <a href="GuiControl.htm#redraw-remarks">Redraw</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Additional (rarely-used) notifications can be detected by using <a href="GuiOnNotify.htm">OnNotify</a>. These notifications are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/controls/bumper-tree-view-control-reference-notifications">documented at Microsoft Docs</a>. Microsoft Docs does not show the numeric value of each notification code; those can be found in the Windows SDK or by searching the Internet.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p id="Enter">To detect when the user has pressed <kbd>Enter</kbd> while a TreeView has focus, use a <a href="GuiControls.htm#DefaultButton">default button</a> (which can be hidden if desired). For example:</p>
<pre>MyGui.Add("Button", "Hidden Default", "OK").OnEvent("Click", ButtonOK)
...
ButtonOK(*) {
    global
    if MyGui.FocusedCtrl != TV
        return
    MsgBox("Enter was pressed. The selected item ID is " TV.GetSelection())
}</pre>
<p>In addition to navigating from item to item with the keyboard, the user may also perform incremental search by typing the first few characters of an item's name. This causes the selection to jump to the nearest matching item.</p>
<p>Although any length of text can be stored in each item of a TreeView, only the first 260 characters are displayed.</p>
<p>Although the theoretical maximum number of items in a TreeView is 65536, item-adding performance will noticeably decrease long before then. This can be alleviated somewhat by using the redraw tip described in the <a href="#Add">Add method</a>.</p>
<p id="ILremarks">Unlike <a href="ListView.htm">ListViews</a>, a TreeView's ImageList is not automatically destroyed when the TreeView is destroyed. Therefore, a script should call <a href="ListView.htm#IL_Destroy">IL_Destroy</a> after destroying a TreeView's window if the ImageList will not be used for anything else. However, this is not necessary if the script will soon be exiting because all ImageLists are automatically destroyed at that time.</p>
<p>A script may create more than one TreeView per window.</p>
<p>To perform actions such as resizing, hiding, or changing the font of a TreeView, see <a href="GuiControl.htm">GuiControl object</a>.</p>
<p>Tree View eXtension (TVX) extends TreeViews to support moving, inserting and deleting. It is demonstrated at <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic19021.html">www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic19021.html</a></p>

    <i>Statements</i>
}</pre>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The <em>try</em> statement is usually followed by a <a href="Block.htm">block</a> - one or more statements (typically functions or expressions) enclosed in braces. If only a single statement is to be executed, it can be placed on the same line as <em>try</em> or on the next line, and the braces can be omitted. To specify code that executes only when <em>try</em> catches an error, use one or more <a href="Catch.htm">catch</a> statements.</p>
<p>If <em>try</em> is used without <em>catch</em> or <em>finally</em>, it is equivalent to having <code>catch Error</code> with an empty block.</p>
<p>A value can be thrown by the <a href="Throw.htm">throw</a> statement or by the program when a runtime error occurs. When a value is thrown from within a try block or a function called by one, the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If there is a <a href="Catch.htm">catch</a> statement which matches the class of the thrown value, execution is transferred into it.</li>
  <li>If there is no matching catch statement but there is a <a href="Finally.htm">finally</a> statement, it is executed, but once it finishes the value is automatically thrown again.</li>
  <li>If there is no matching catch statement or finally statement, the value is automatically thrown again (unless there is no <em>catch</em> or <em>finally</em> at all, as noted above).</li>
</ul>
<p>The last <em>catch</em> can optionally be followed by <a href="Else.htm"><em>else</em></a>. If the try statement completes without an exception being thrown (and without control being transferred elsewhere by <em>return</em>, <em>break</em> or similar), the <em>else</em> statement is executed. Exceptions thrown by the <em>else</em> statement are not handled by its associated try statement, but may be handled by an enclosing try statement. <em>Finally</em> can also be present, but must be placed after <em>else</em>, and is always executed last.</p>
<p>The <a href="Block.htm#otb">One True Brace (OTB) style</a> may optionally be used with the <em>try</em> statement. For example:</p>
<pre>try {
    ...
} catch Error as err {
    ...
} else {
    ...
} finally {
    ...
}</pre>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
<p>This function returns the class name of <em>Value</em>.</p>
<p>The algorithm for determining a value's class name can be approximated as shown below:</p>
<pre>
TypeOf(Value)
{
    if (comClass := ComObjType(Value, "Class")) != ""
        return comClass

            return Value.__Class
    return "Object"
}
</pre>
<p>For COM wrapper objects, the class name can also be determined based on the <a href="ComObjType.htm#vt">variant type</a>, as follows:</p>
<pre>
ComObject_Type(obj)
{
    if ComObjType(obj) &amp; 0x2000 <em>; VT_ARRAY</em>

        &amp;&amp; ComObjValue(obj) != 0
    {

    }
    return "ComValue" <em>; ComValue.Prototype.__Class</em>
}
</pre>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This function typically shouldn't be used to determine if a value is numeric, since numeric <em>strings</em> are valid in math expressions and with most built-in functions. However, in some cases the exact type of a value is more important. In such cases, consider using <code>Value is Number</code> or similar instead of Type.</p>
<p>To check if a value can be used as a number, use the <a href="Is.htm#number">IsNumber</a>, <a href="Is.htm#integer">IsInteger</a> or <a href="Is.htm#float">IsFloat</a> function.</p>
<p>To check for any type of object (that is, anything which is not a primitive value), use the <a href="IsObject.htm">IsObject</a> function.</p>
<p>To check if a value is an instance of a specific class, use the <a href="../Variables.htm#is"><code>is</code></a> operator. This can be used even with primitive values or to identify <a href="ComValue.htm">COM wrapper objects</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The space or tab after <code>Until</code> is optional if the expression is enclosed in parentheses, as in <code>until(expression)</code>.</p>
<p>The expression is evaluated once after each iteration, and is evaluated even if <a href="Continue.htm">continue</a> was used. If the expression evaluates to false (which is an empty string or the number 0), the loop continues; otherwise, the loop is broken and execution continues at the line following <i>Until</i>.</p>
<p>Loop Until is shorthand for the following:</p>
<pre>Loop {
    ...
    if (<i>Expression</i>)
        break
}</pre>
<p>However, Loop Until is often easier to understand and unlike the above, can be used with a single-line action. For example:</p>
<pre>Loop
    x *= 2
Until x &gt; y</pre>
<p><i>Until</i> can be used with any Loop or For. For example:</p>
<pre>Loop Read, A_ScriptFullPath
    lines .= A_LoopReadLine . "`n"
Until A_Index=5  <em>; Read the first five lines.</em>
MsgBox lines
</pre>
<p>If <a href="../Variables.htm#Index">A_Index</a> is used in <i>Expression</i>, it contains the index of the iteration which has just finished.</p>

<p>Enlarges a variable's holding capacity or frees its memory. This is not normally needed, but may be used with <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> or <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> or to optimize repeated concatenation.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">GrantedCapacity := <span class="func">VarSetStrCapacity</span>(&amp;TargetVar <span class="optional">, RequestedCapacity</span>)</pre>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>&amp;TargetVar</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a></p>
    <p>A reference to a variable. For example: <code>VarSetStrCapacity(&amp;MyVar, 1000)</code>. This can also be a dynamic variable such as <code>Array%i%</code> or a <a href="../Functions.htm#ByRef">function's ByRef parameter</a>.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>RequestedCapacity</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
    <p>If omitted, the variable's current capacity will be returned and its contents will not be altered. Otherwise, anything currently in the variable is lost (the variable becomes blank).</p>
    <p>Specify for <em>RequestedCapacity</em> the number of characters that the variable should be able to hold after the adjustment. <em>RequestedCapacity</em> does not include the internal zero terminator. For example, specifying 1 would allow the variable to hold up to one character in addition to its internal terminator. Note: the variable will auto-expand if the script assigns it a larger value later.</p>
    <p>Since this function is often called simply to ensure the variable has a certain minimum capacity, for performance reasons, it shrinks the variable only when <em>RequestedCapacity</em> is 0. In other words, if the variable's capacity is already greater than <em>RequestedCapacity</em>, it will not be reduced (but the variable will still made blank for consistency).</p>
    <p>Therefore, to explicitly shrink a variable, first free its memory with <code>VarSetStrCapacity(&amp;Var, 0)</code> and then use <code>VarSetStrCapacity(&amp;Var, NewCapacity)</code> -- or simply let it auto-expand from zero as needed.</p>
    <p>For performance reasons, freeing a variable whose previous capacity was less than 64 characters might have no effect because its memory is of a permanent type. In this case, the current capacity will be returned rather than 0.</p>
    <p>For performance reasons, the memory of a variable whose capacity is less than 4096 bytes is not freed by storing an empty string in it (e.g. <code>Var := ""</code>). However, <code>VarSetStrCapacity(&amp;Var, 0)</code> does free it.</p>
    <p id="neg1">Specify -1 for <em>RequestedCapacity</em> to update the variable's internally-stored string length to the length of its current contents. This is useful in cases where the string has been altered indirectly, such as by passing its <a href="StrPtr.htm">address</a> via <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> or <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>. In this mode, VarSetStrCapacity returns the length rather than the capacity.</p>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a></p>
<p>This function returns the number of characters that Var can now hold, which will be greater than or equal to <em>RequestedCapacity</em>.</p>

<h2 id="Failure">Failure</h2>
<p>An exception is thrown under any of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>TargetVar</em> is not a valid variable reference. It is not possible to pass an <a href="../Objects.htm#Usage_Objects">object property</a> or <a href="../Variables.htm#BuiltIn">built-in variable</a> by reference, and therefore not valid to pass one to this function.</li>
  <li>The requested capacity is too large to fit within any single contiguous memory block available to the script. In rare cases, this may be due to the system running out of memory.</li>
  <li><em>RequestedCapacity</em> is less than -1 or greater than can theoretically be supported by the current platform.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The <a href="Buffer.htm">Buffer</a> object offers superior clarity and flexibility when dealing with binary data, structures, DllCall and similar. For instance, a Buffer object can be assigned to a property or array element or be passed to or returned from a function without copying its contents.</p>
<p>This function can be used to enhance performance when building a string by means of gradual concatenation. This is because multiple automatic resizings can be avoided when you have some idea of what the string's final length will be. In such a case, <em>RequestedCapacity</em> need not be accurate: if the capacity is too small, performance is still improved and the variable will begin auto-expanding when the capacity has been exhausted. If the capacity is too large, some of the memory is wasted, but only temporarily because all the memory can be freed after the operation by means of <code>VarSetStrCapacity(&amp;Var, 0)</code> or <code>Var := ""</code>.</p>

<p>Performs a series of functions repeatedly until the specified <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a> evaluates to false.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">While</span> <i>Expression</i></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Expression</dt>
  <dd><p>Any valid <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>. For example: <code>while x &lt; y</code>.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The space or tab after <code>While</code> is optional if the expression is enclosed in parentheses, as in <code>While(expression)</code>.</p>
<p>The expression is evaluated once before each iteration. If the expression evaluates to true (which is any result other than an empty string or the number 0), the body of the loop is executed; otherwise, execution jumps to the line following the loop's body.</p>
<p>A while-loop is usually followed by a <a href="Block.htm">block</a>, which is a collection of statements that form the <em>body</em> of the loop. However, a loop with only a single statement does not require a block (an "if" and its "else" count as a single statement for this purpose).</p>
<p id="otb">The One True Brace (OTB) style may optionally be used, which allows the open-brace to appear on the same line rather than underneath. For example: <code>while x &lt; y {</code>.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_Index</strong> contains the number of the current loop iteration. It contains 1 the first time the loop's expression and body are executed. For the second time, it contains 2; and so on. If an inner loop is enclosed by an outer loop, the inner loop takes precedence. A_Index works inside all types of loops, but contains 0 outside of a loop.</p>
<p>As with all loops, <a href="Break.htm">Break</a> may be used to exit the loop prematurely. Also, <a href="Continue.htm">Continue</a> may be used to skip the rest of the current iteration, at which time A_Index is increased by 1 and the while-loop's expression is re-evaluated. If it is still true, a new iteration begins; otherwise, the loop ends.</p>
<p>The loop may optionally be followed by an <a href="Else.htm">Else</a> statement, which is executed if the loop had zero iterations.</p>
<p>Specialized loops: Loops can be used to automatically retrieve files, folders, or registry items (one at a time). See <a href="LoopFiles.htm">file-loop</a> and <a href="LoopReg.htm">registry-loop</a> for details. In addition, <a href="LoopRead.htm">file-reading loops</a> can operate on the entire contents of a file, one line at a time. Finally, <a href="LoopParse.htm">parsing loops</a> can operate on the individual fields contained inside a delimited string.</p>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>A <a href="Error.htm#TargetError">TargetError</a> is thrown if the window could not be found.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>When an inactive window becomes active, the operating system also makes it foremost (brings it to the top of the stack). This does not occur if the window is already active.</p>
<p>If the window is minimized and inactive, it is automatically restored prior to being activated. If <em>WinTitle</em> is the letter "A" and the other parameters are omitted, the active window is restored. The window is restored even if it was already active.</p>
<p>Six attempts will be made to activate the target window over the course of 60ms. If all six attempts fail, WinActivate automatically sends <code>{Alt 2}</code> as a workaround for possible restrictions enforced by the operating system, and then makes a seventh attempt. Thus, it is usually unnecessary to follow WinActivate with <a href="WinWaitActive.htm">WinWaitActive</a> or <code>if not <a href="WinActive.htm">WinActive</a>(...)</code>.</p>
<p>After WinActivate's first failed attempt, it automatically sends <code>{Alt up}</code>. Testing has shown that this may improve the reliability of all subsequent attempts, reducing the number of instances where the first attempt fails and causes the taskbar button to flash. No more than one <code>{Alt up}</code> is sent for this purpose for the lifetime of each script. If this or any other (AutoHotkey v1.1.27+) script has a keyboard hook installed, the <code>{Alt up}</code> is blocked from the active window, minimizing the already small risk of side-effects.</p>
<p>In general, if more than one window matches, the topmost matching window (typically the one most recently used) will be activated. If the window is already active, it will be kept active rather than activating any other matching window beneath it. However, if the active window is moved to the bottom of the stack with <a href="WinMoveBottom.htm">WinMoveBottom</a>, some other window may be activated even if the active window is a match.</p>
<p><a href="WinActivateBottom.htm">WinActivateBottom</a> activates the bottommost matching window (typically the one least recently used).</p>
<p><a href="GroupActivate.htm">GroupActivate</a> activates the next window that matches criteria specified by a window group.</p>
<p>If the active window is hidden and <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> is turned off, it is never considered a match. Instead, a visible matching window is activated if one exists.</p>
<p>When a window is activated immediately after the activation of some other window, task bar buttons might start flashing on some systems (depending on OS and settings). To prevent this, use <a href="_WinActivateForce.htm">#WinActivateForce</a>.</p>
<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>
<p><strong>Known issue:</strong> If the script is running on a computer or server being accessed via remote desktop, WinActivate may hang if the remote desktop client is minimized. One workaround is to use built-in functions which don't require window activation, such as <a href="ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a> and <a href="ControlClick.htm">ControlClick</a>. Another possible workaround is to apply the following registry setting on the local/client computer:</p>
<pre><em>; Change HKCU to HKLM to affect all users on this system.</em>
RegWrite "REG_DWORD", "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"
    , "RemoteDesktop_SuppressWhenMinimized", 2</pre>

<p>This function sends a close message to a window. The result depends on the window (it may ask to save data, etc.)</p>
<p>If a matching window is active, that window will be closed in preference to any other matching window. In general, if more than one window matches, the topmost (most recently used) will be closed.</p>
<p id="group">This function operates only upon a single window except when <em>WinTitle</em> is <a href="GroupAdd.htm">ahk_group GroupName</a> (with no other criteria specified), in which case all windows in the group are affected.</p>
<p>WinClose sends a WM_CLOSE message to the target window, which is a somewhat forceful method of closing it. An alternate method of closing is to send the following message. It might produce different behavior because it is similar in effect to pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> or clicking the window's close button in its title bar:</p>
<pre>PostMessage 0x0112, 0xF060,,, WinTitle, WinText  <em>; 0x0112 = WM_SYSCOMMAND, 0xF060 = SC_CLOSE</em></pre>

<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>
<p>As the coordinates returned by this function include the window's title bar, menu and borders, they may be dependent on OS version and theme. To get more consistent values across different systems, consider using <a href="WinGetClientPos.htm">WinGetClientPos</a> instead.</p>
<p>On systems with multiple screens which have different DPI settings, the returned position and size may be different than expected due to <a href="../misc/DPIScaling.htm">OS DPI scaling</a>.</p>

<p>An <a href="Error.htm">Error</a> is thrown if there was a problem retrieving the window's text.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The text retrieved is generally the same as what Window Spy shows for that window. However, if <a href="DetectHiddenText.htm">DetectHiddenText</a> has been turned off, hidden text is omitted from the return value.</p>
<p>Each text element ends with a carriage return and linefeed (CR+LF), which can be represented in the script as `r`n. To extract individual lines or substrings, use functions such as <a href="InStr.htm">InStr</a> and <a href="SubStr.htm">SubStr</a>. A  <a href="LoopParse.htm">parsing loop</a> can also be used to examine each line or word one by one.</p>
<p>If the retrieved text appears to be truncated (incomplete), it may be necessary to retrieve the text by sending the WM_GETTEXT message via <a href="SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> instead. This is because some applications do not respond properly to the WM_GETTEXTLENGTH message, which causes AutoHotkey to make the return value too small to fit all the text.</p>
<p>This function might use a large amount of RAM if the target window (e.g. an editor with a large document open) contains a large quantity of text. To avoid this, it might be possible to retrieve only portions of the window's text by using <a href="ControlGetText.htm">ControlGetText</a> instead. In any case, a variable's memory can be freed later by assigning it to nothing, i.e. <code>Text := ""</code>.</p>
<p>To retrieve a list of all controls in a window, follow this example: <code>Controls := <a href="WinGetControls.htm">WinGetControls</a>(<i>WinTitle</i>)</code></p>
<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>

<p>WinMinimize minimizes the window using a direct method, bypassing the window message which is usually sent when the minimize button, window menu or taskbar is used to minimize the window. This prevents the window from overriding the action (such as to "minimize" to the taskbar by hiding the window), but may also prevent the window from responding correctly, such as to save the <a href="ControlGetFocus.htm">current focus</a> for when the window is restored. It also prevents the "minimize" system sound from being played.</p>

<p>If <em>Width</em> and <em>Height</em> are small (or negative), most windows with a title bar will generally go no smaller than 112 x 27 pixels (however, some types of windows may have a different minimum size). If <em>Width</em> and <em>Height</em> are large, most windows will go no larger than approximately 12 pixels beyond the dimensions of the desktop.</p>
<p>Negative values are allowed for the x and y coordinates to support multi-monitor systems and to allow a window to be moved entirely off screen.</p>
<p>Although WinMove cannot move minimized windows, it can move hidden windows if <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> is on.</p>
<p>The speed of WinMove is affected by <a href="SetWinDelay.htm">SetWinDelay</a>.</p>
<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>

<p>On systems with multiple screens which have different DPI settings, the final position and size of the window may differ from the requested values due to <a href="../misc/DPIScaling.htm">OS DPI scaling</a>.</p>

<p>However, the system default settings will probably cause it to activate in most cases.

<h1>WinSetRegion</h1>

<p>Changes the shape of the specified window to be the specified rectangle, ellipse, or polygon.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">WinSetRegion</span> <span class="optional">Options, WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</span></pre>

        <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
        <p>If blank or omitted, the window is restored to its original/default display area. Otherwise, one or more of the following options can be specified, each separated from the others with space(s):</p>
        <p><strong>Wn</strong>: Width of rectangle or ellipse. For example: <code>w200</code>.</p>
        <p><strong>Hn</strong>: Height of rectangle or ellipse. For example: <code>h200</code>.</p>
        <p><strong>X-Y</strong>: Each of these is a pair of X/Y coordinates. For example, <code>200-0</code> would use 200 for the X coordinate and 0 for the Y.</p>
        <p><strong>E</strong>: Makes the region an ellipse rather than a rectangle. This option is valid only when <strong>W</strong> and <strong>H</strong> are present.</p>
        <p><strong>R[w-h]</strong>: Makes the region a rectangle with rounded corners. For example, <code>R30-30</code> would use a 30x30 ellipse for each corner. If <strong>w-h</strong> is omitted, 30-30 is used. <strong>R</strong> is valid only when <strong>W</strong> and <strong>H</strong> are present.</p>
        <p><strong>Rectangle or ellipse</strong>: If the <strong>W</strong> and <strong>H</strong> options are present, the new display area will be a rectangle whose upper left corner is specified by the first (and only) pair of <strong>X-Y</strong> coordinates. However, if the <strong>E</strong> option is also present, the new display area will be an ellipse rather than a rectangle. For example: <code>WinSetRegion "50-0 W200 H250 E", <i>WinTitle</i></code>.</p>
        <p><strong>Polygon</strong>: When the <strong>W</strong> and <strong>H</strong> options are absent, the new display area will be a polygon determined by multiple pairs of <strong>X-Y</strong> coordinates (each pair of coordinates is a point inside the window relative to its upper left corner). For example, if three pairs of coordinates are specified, the new display area will be a triangle in most cases. The order of the coordinate pairs with respect to each other is sometimes important. In addition, the word <strong>Wind</strong> maybe be present in <em>Options</em> to use the winding method instead of the alternating method to determine the polygon's region.</p>

<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>
<p>When a region is set for a window owned by the script, the system may automatically change the method it uses to render the window's frame, thereby altering its appearance. The effect is similar to workaround #2 shown below, but only affects the window until its region is reset.</p>
<p><strong>Known limitation</strong>: Setting a region for a window not owned by the script may produce unexpected results if the window has a caption (title bar), and the system has desktop composition enabled. This is because the visible frame is not actually part of the window, but rendered by a separate system process known as the "desktop window manager". Note that desktop composition is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/desktop-window-manager-is-always-on">always enabled</a> on Windows 8 and later. One of the following two workarounds can be used:</p>
<pre><em>; #1: Remove the window's caption.</em>
WinSetStyle "-0xC00000", "Window Title"

<em>; To undo it:</em>
WinSetStyle "+0xC00000", "Window Title"</pre>
<pre><em>; #2: Disable DWM rendering of the window's frame.</em>
DllCall("dwmapi\DwmSetWindowAttribute", "ptr", WinExist("Window Title")
  , "uint", DWMWA_NCRENDERING_POLICY := 2, "int*", DWMNCRP_DISABLED := 1, "uint", 4)
  
<em>; To undo it (this might also cause any set region to be ignored):</em>
DllCall("dwmapi\DwmSetWindowAttribute", "ptr", WinExist("Window Title")
  , "uint", DWMWA_NCRENDERING_POLICY := 2, "int*", DWMNCRP_ENABLED := 2, "uint", 4)

        <p>If the value is a string, any numeric color value must be in hexadecimal format. The color value can be omitted; for example, <code>WinSetTransColor " 150"</code> (with the leading space) is equivalent to <code>WinSetTransparent 150</code>.</p>

        <p>To enable transparency, specify a number between 0 and 255 indicating the degree of transparency: 0 makes the window invisible while 255 makes it opaque.</p>
        <p>The word <code>"Off"</code> (case-insensitive) may be specified to completely turn off transparency for a window. This is functionally identical to <code><a href="WinSetTransColor.htm">WinSetTransColor</a> "Off", <i>WinTitle</i></code>. Specifying <code>"Off"</code> is different than specifying 255 because it may improve performance and reduce usage of system resources (but probably only when desktop composition is disabled).</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>For example, to make the task bar transparent, use <code>WinSetTransparent 150, "ahk_class Shell_TrayWnd"</code>. Similarly, to make the classic Start Menu transparent, see <a href="#ExTransStartMenu">example #2</a>. To make the Start Menu's submenus transparent, also include the script from <a href="#ExTransMenu">example #3</a>.</p>
<p>Setting the transparency level to 255 before using <code>"Off"</code> might avoid window redrawing problems such as a black background. If the window still fails to be redrawn correctly, see <a href="WinRedraw.htm">WinRedraw</a> for a possible workaround.</p>
<p>The ID of the window under the mouse cursor can be retrieved with <a href="MouseGetPos.htm">MouseGetPos</a>.</p>
<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>

<p>Whenever no matching windows exist, the function will not wait for <em>Timeout</em> to expire. Instead, it will immediately return 1 and the script will continue executing. Conversely, the function may continue waiting even after a matching window is closed, until no more matching windows can be found.</p>

<p>WinWaitClose updates the <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow">Last Found Window</a> whenever it finds a matching window. One use for this is to identify or operate on the window after the function times out. For example:</p>
<pre>

if !WinWaitClose("Test",, 5)  <em>; Wait 5 seconds for someone to close it.</em>

    <p>The length of the interval in milliseconds. Specify -1 to have it keep trying indefinitely. Specify 0 to have it try only once. Scripts that do not contain this directive use a 1000 ms timeout.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Some applications keep the clipboard open for long periods of time, perhaps to write or read large amounts of data. In such cases, increasing this setting causes the script to wait longer before giving up and displaying an error message.</p>
<p>This settings applies to all <a href="A_Clipboard.htm">clipboard</a> operations, the simplest of which are the following examples: <code>Var := A_Clipboard</code> and <code>A_Clipboard := "New Text"</code>.</p>
<p>Whenever the script is waiting for the clipboard to become available, new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> <u>cannot</u> be launched and <a href="SetTimer.htm">timers</a> will not run. However, if the user presses a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, selects a <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or performs a <a href="Gui.htm">GUI action</a> such as pressing a button, that event will be buffered until later; in other words, its subroutine will be performed after the clipboard finally becomes available.</p>
<p>This directive does <strong>not</strong> cause the reading of clipboard data to be reattempted if the first attempt fails.</p>
<p>Like other directives, #ClipboardTimeout cannot be executed conditionally.</p>

<h1>#DllLoad</h1>

<p><a href="DllCall.htm#load">Loads</a> a DLL or EXE file before the script starts executing.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">#DllLoad</span> <span class="optional">FileOrDirName</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>FileOrDirName</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The path of a file or directory as explained below. This <strong>must not</strong> contain double quotes, wildcards or <a href="../misc/EscapeChar.htm">escape sequences</a> other than semicolon (<strong>`;</strong>).</p>
    <p>Built-in variables may be used by enclosing them in percent signs (for example, <code>#DllLoad %A_ScriptDir%</code>). Percent signs which are not part of a valid variable reference are interpreted literally. All built-in variables are valid, except for <a href="../Variables.htm#Args">A_Args</a> and built-in classes.</p>
    <p>Known limitation: When compiling a script, variables are evaluated by the compiler and may differ from what the script would return when it is finally executed. The following variables are supported: A_AhkPath, A_AppData, A_AppDataCommon, A_ComputerName, A_ComSpec, A_Desktop, A_DesktopCommon, A_IsCompiled, A_LineFile, A_MyDocuments, A_ProgramFiles, A_Programs, A_ProgramsCommon, A_ScriptDir, A_ScriptFullPath, A_ScriptName, A_Space, A_StartMenu, A_StartMenuCommon, A_Startup, A_StartupCommon, A_Tab, A_Temp, A_UserName, A_WinDir.</p>
    <p><strong>File:</strong> The absolute or relative path to the DLL or EXE file to be loaded. If a relative path is specified, the directive searches for the file using the same search strategy as the system's function <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibraryw">LoadLibraryW</a>. Note: <a href="SetWorkingDir.htm">SetWorkingDir</a> has no effect on #DllLoad because #DllLoad is processed before the script begins executing.</p>
    <p><strong>Directory:</strong> Specify a directory instead of a file to alter the search strategy by all subsequent occurrences of #DllLoad which do not specify an absolute path to a DLL or EXE. The new search strategy is the same as if <em>Directory</em> was passed to the system's function <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setdlldirectoryw">SetDllDirectoryW</a>. If this parameter is omitted, the default search strategy is restored.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This parameter is not an expression, but can be enclosed in quote marks (either 'single' or "double").</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Once a DLL or EXE has been loaded by this directive it cannot be unloaded by calling the system's function <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-freelibrary">FreeLibrary</a>. When the script is terminated, all loaded files are unloaded automatically.</p>
<p>The <em>FileName</em> parameter may optionally begin with <code>*i</code> and a single space, which causes the program to ignore any failure to load the file. This option should be used only if the script is capable of executing despite the failure, such as if the DLL or EXE is non-essential, or if the script is designed to detect the failure. For example:</p>
<pre>#DllLoad "*i MyDLL"
if !DllCall("GetModuleHandle", "str", "MyDLL")
    MsgBox "Failed to load MyDLL!"</pre>
<p>If the <em>FileName</em> parameter specifies a DLL name without a path and the file name extension is omitted, <em>.dll</em> is appended to the file name. To prevent this, include a trailing point character (.) in the file name.</p>
<p>Like other directives, #DllLoad cannot be executed conditionally.</p>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Encoding</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>An <a href="FileEncoding.htm">encoding string</a> specifying how to encode the output. For example, <code>#ErrorStdOut "UTF-8"</code> encodes error messages as UTF-8 before sending them to stderr. Whatever program is capturing the output must support UTF-8, and in some cases may need to be configured to expect it. If omitted, it defaults to CP0.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This parameter is not an expression, but can be enclosed in quote marks (either 'single' or "double").</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Errors are written to stderr instead of stdout. The command prompt and fancy editors usually display both.</p>
<p>This allows fancy editors such as TextPad, SciTE, Crimson, and EditPlus to jump to the offending line when a syntax error occurs. Since the #ErrorStdOut directive would have to be added to every script, it is usually better to set up your editor to use the <a href="../Scripts.htm#cmd">command line switch</a> <strong>/ErrorStdOut</strong> when launching any AutoHotkey script (see further below for setup instructions).</p>
<p>Because AutoHotkey is not a console program, errors will not appear at the command prompt directly. This can be worked around by 1) compiling the script with the <a href="../misc/Ahk2ExeDirectives.htm#ConsoleApp">Ahk2Exe ConsoleApp directive</a>, or 2) capturing the script's output via piping or redirection. For example:</p>
<pre class="no-highlight">"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" /ErrorStdOut "My Script.ahk" <strong>2&gt;&amp;1 |more</strong>
"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" /ErrorStdOut "My Script.ahk" <strong>2&gt;"Syntax-Error Log.txt"</strong></pre>
<p>You can also pipe the output directly to the clipboard by using the operating system's built-in clip command. For example:</p>
<pre class="no-highlight">"C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" /ErrorStdOut "My Script.ahk" <strong>2&gt;&amp;1 |clip</strong></pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code> causes stderr to be redirected to stdout, while <code>2&gt;<i>Filename</i></code> redirects only stderr to a file.</p>
<p>Like other directives, #ErrorStdOut cannot be executed conditionally.</p>

<h1>#HotIf</h1>

<p>Creates context-sensitive <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> and <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a>. Such hotkeys perform a different action (or none at all) depending on any condition (an <a href="../Language.htm#expressions">expression</a>).</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">#HotIf</span> <span class="optional">Expression</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Expression</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#boolean">Boolean</a></p>
    <p>Any valid <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>. This becomes the return value of an implicit function which has one parameter (<a href="../Hotkeys.htm#ThisHotkey">ThisHotkey</a>). The function cannot modify global variables directly (as it is <a href="../Functions.htm#AssumeLocal">assume-local</a> as usual, and cannot contain declarations), but can call other functions which do.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="howto">Basic Operation</h2>
<p>The #HotIf directive sets the expression which will be used by subsequently created hotkeys to determine whether they should activate. This expression is evaluated when the key, mouse button or combination is pressed, or at other times when the program needs to know whether the hotkey is active.</p>
<p>To make context-sensitive <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a> and <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a>, simply precede them with the #HotIf directive. For example:</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActive("ahk_class Notepad") or WinActive(MyWindowTitle)
#Space::MsgBox "You pressed Win+Spacebar in Notepad or " MyWindowTitle</pre>
<p>The #HotIf directive is positional: it affects all hotkeys and hotstrings physically beneath it in the script, until the next #HotIf directive.</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike <a href="If.htm">if statements</a>, braces have no effect with the #HotIf directive.</p>
<p>To turn off context sensitivity, specify #HotIf without any expression. For example:</p>
<pre>#HotIf</pre>
<p>Like other directives, #HotIf cannot be executed conditionally.</p>
<p>When a mouse or keyboard hotkey is disabled via #HotIf, it performs its native function; that is, it passes through to the active window as though there is no such hotkey. There is one exception: Joystick hotkeys: although #HotIf works, it never prevents other programs from seeing the press of a button.</p>
<p>#HotIf can also be used to alter the behavior of an ordinary key like <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd>. This is useful when a particular window ignores that key or performs some action you find undesirable. For example:</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActive("Reminders ahk_class #32770")  <em>; The "reminders" window in Outlook.</em>
Enter::Send "!o"  <em>; Have an "Enter" keystroke open the selected reminder rather than snoozing it.</em>
#HotIf</pre>

<h2 id="variant">Variant (Duplicate) Hotkeys</h2>
<p>A particular <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> or <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstring</a> can be defined more than once in the script if each definition has different #HotIf criteria. These are known as <em>hotkey variants</em>. For example:</p>
<pre>#HotIf <a href="WinActive.htm">WinActive</a>("ahk_class Notepad")
^!c::MsgBox "You pressed Control+Alt+C in Notepad."
#HotIf WinActive("ahk_class WordPadClass")
^!c::MsgBox "You pressed Control+Alt+C in WordPad."
#HotIf
^!c::MsgBox "You pressed Control+Alt+C in a window other than Notepad/WordPad."</pre>
<p>If more than one variant is eligible to fire, only the one closest to the top of the script will fire. The exception to this is the global variant (the one with no #HotIf criteria): It always has the lowest precedence; therefore, it will fire only if no other variant is eligible (this exception does not apply to <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstrings</a>).</p>
<p>When creating duplicate hotkeys, the order of <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Symbols">modifier symbols</a> such as ^!+# does not matter. For example, <code>^!c</code> is the same as <code>!^c</code>. However, keys must be spelled consistently. For example, <em>Esc</em> is not the same as <em>Escape</em> for this purpose (though the case does not matter). Also, any hotkey with a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#wildcard">wildcard prefix (*)</a> is entirely separate from a non-wildcard one; for example, <code>*F1</code> and <code>F1</code> would each have their own set of variants.</p>

<p>A <a href="GroupAdd.htm">window group</a> can be used to make a hotkey execute for a group of windows. For example:
<pre>
GroupAdd "MyGroup", "ahk_class Notepad"
GroupAdd "MyGroup", "ahk_class WordPadClass"

#HotIf WinActive("ahk_group MyGroup")
#z::MsgBox "You pressed Win+Z in either Notepad or WordPad."
</pre>
</p>
<p>To create hotkey variants dynamically (while the script is running), see <a href="HotIf.htm">HotIf</a>.</p>

<h2 id="expression-evaluation">Expression Evaluation</h2>
<p>When the key, mouse or joystick button combination which forms a hotkey is pressed, the #HotIf expression is evaluated to determine if the hotkey should activate.</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Scripts should not assume that the expression is only evaluated when the key is pressed (see below).</p>
<p>The expression may also be evaluated whenever the program needs to know whether the hotkey is active. For example, the #HotIf expression for a custom combination like <code>a &amp; b::</code> might be evaluated when the prefix key (<code>a</code> in this example) is pressed, to determine whether it should act as a custom modifier key.</p>
<p class="warning" id="lag"><strong>Note:</strong> Use of #HotIf in an unresponsive script may cause input lag or break hotkeys (see below).</p>
<p>There are several more caveats to the #HotIf directive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keyboard or mouse input is typically buffered (delayed) until expression evaluation completes or <a href="_HotIfTimeout.htm">times out</a>.</li>
  <li>Expression evaluation can only be performed by the script's main thread (at the OS level, not a <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">quasi-thread</a>), not directly by the keyboard/mouse hook. If the script is busy or unresponsive, such as if a FileCopy is in progress, expression evaluation is delayed and may time out.</li>
  <li>If the <a href="_HotIfTimeout.htm#LowLevelHooksTimeout">system-defined timeout</a> is reached, the system may stop notifying the script of keyboard or mouse input (see #HotIfTimeout for details).</li>
  <li>Sending keystrokes or mouse clicks while the expression is being evaluated (such as from a function which it calls) may cause complications and should be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../Hotkeys.htm#ThisHotkey">ThisHotkey</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ThisHotkey">A_ThisHotkey</a> and <a href="../Variables.htm#TimeSinceThisHotkey">A_TimeSinceThisHotkey</a> are set based on the hotkey for which the current #HotIf expression is being evaluated.</p>
<p><a href="../Variables.htm#PriorHotkey">A_PriorHotkey</a> and <a href="../Variables.htm#TimeSincePriorHotkey">A_TimeSincePriorHotkey</a> temporarily contain the previous values of the corresponding "This" variables.</p>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>#HotIf is optimized to avoid expression evaluation for simple calls to <a href="WinActive.htm">WinActive</a> or <a href="WinExist.htm">WinExist</a>, thereby reducing the <a href="#lag">risk of lag</a> or other issues in such cases. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The expression must contain exactly one call to <a href="WinExist.htm">WinExist</a> or <a href="WinActive.htm">WinActive</a>.</li>
  <li>Each parameter must be a single quoted string, and no more than two parameters may be used.</li>
  <li>The result may be inverted with <code>not</code> or <code>!</code>, but no other operators may be used.</li>
  <li>Whitespace and parentheses are fully handled when the expression is pre-compiled and therefore do not affect this optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the expression meets these criteria, it is evaluated directly by the program and does not appear in <a href="ListLines.htm">ListLines</a>.</p>
<p>Before the <a href="Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> function is used to modify an existing hotkey variant, typically the <a href="HotIf.htm">HotIf</a> function must be used with the original expression text. However, the first unique expression with a given combination of criteria can also be referenced by that criteria. For example:</p>
<pre>
HotIfWinExist "ahk_class Notepad"
Hotkey "#n", "Off"  <em>; Turn the hotkey off.</em>
HotIf 'WinExist("ahk_class Notepad")'
Hotkey "#n", "On"   <em>; Turn the same hotkey back on.</em>

#HotIf WinExist("ahk_class Notepad")
#n::WinActivate
</pre>
<p>Note that any use of variables will disqualify the expression. If the variable's value never changes after the hotkey is created, there are two strategies for minimizing the risk of lag or other issues inherent to #HotIf:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <code class="no-highlight"><a href="HotIf.htm#IfWin">HotIfWin...</a> MyTitleVar</code> to set the criteria and <code><a href="Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> KeyName, Label</code> to create the hotkey variant.</li>
  <li>Use a constant expression such as <code>#HotIf WinActive("ahk_group MyGroup")</code> and define the window group with <code><a href="GroupAdd.htm">GroupAdd</a> "MyGroup", MyTitleVar</code> elsewhere in the script.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-remarks">General Remarks</h2>
<p>#HotIf also restores prefix keys to their native function when appropriate (a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#prefix">prefix key</a> is <kbd>A</kbd> in a hotkey such as <code>a &amp; b</code>). This occurs whenever there are no enabled hotkeys for a given prefix.</p>
<p>When a hotkey is currently disabled via #HotIf, its key or mouse button will appear with a "#" character in <a href="KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory's</a> "Type" column. This can help debug a script.</p>
<p><a href="../Hotkeys.htm#alttab">Alt-tab hotkeys</a> are not affected by #HotIf: they are in effect for all windows.</p>
<p>The <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm#LastFoundWindow">Last Found Window</a> can be set by #HotIf. For example:</p>
<pre>#HotIf <a href="WinExist.htm">WinExist</a>("ahk_class Notepad")
#n::<a href="WinActivate.htm">WinActivate</a>  <em>; Activates the window found by WinExist().</em></pre>

<p>A timeout is implemented to prevent long-running expressions from stalling keyboard input processing. If the timeout value is exceeded, the expression continues to evaluate, but the keyboard hook continues as if the expression had already returned false.</p>
<p>If this directive is unspecified in the script, it will behave as though set to 1000.</p>
<p id="LowLevelHooksTimeout">Note that the system implements its own timeout, defined by the DWORD value <em>LowLevelHooksTimeout</em> in the following registry key:</p>
<p><b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop</b></p>
<p>If the system timeout value is exceeded, the system may stop calling the script's keyboard hook, thereby preventing hook hotkeys from working until the hook is re-registered or the script is <a href="Reload.htm">reloaded</a>. The hook can <em>usually</em> be re-registered by <a href="Suspend.htm">suspending</a> and un-suspending all hotkeys.</p>
<p>Microsoft's documentation is unclear about the details of this timeout, but research indicates the following for Windows 7 and later: If <em>LowLevelHooksTimeout</em> is not defined, the default timeout is 300ms. The hook may time out up to 10 times, but is silently removed if it times out an 11th time.</p>
<p>If a given hotkey has multiple #HotIf variants, the timeout might be applied to each variant independently, making it more likely that the system timeout will be exceeded. This may be changed in a future update.</p>
<p>Like other directives, #HotIfTimeout cannot be executed conditionally.</p>

    <p>Prevents mouse clicks from resetting the hotstring recognizer as described <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#NoMouse">here</a>. As a side-effect, this also prevents the <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse hook</a> from being required by hotstrings (though it will still be installed if the script requires it for other purposes, such as mouse hotkeys). The presence of <code>#Hotstring NoMouse</code> anywhere in the script affects all hotstrings, not just those physically beneath it.</p>

    <p>Since the new ending characters are in effect globally for the entire script -- regardless of where the EndChars directive appears -- there is no need to specify EndChars more than once.</p>
    <p>The maximum number of ending characters is 100. Characters beyond this length are ignored.</p>

    <p>Unlike <em>EndChars</em> above, the #Hotstring directive is positional when used this way. In other words, entire sections of hotstrings can have different default options as in this example:</p>
    <pre>::btw::by the way

#Hotstring r c  <em>; All the below hotstrings will use "send raw" and will be case sensitive by default.</em>

<dl>

  <dt>FileOrDirName</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The path of a file or directory as explained below. This <strong>must not</strong> contain double quotes (except for an optional pair of double quotes surrounding the parameter), wildcards or <a href="../misc/EscapeChar.htm">escape sequences</a> other than semicolon (<strong>`;</strong>).</p>
    <p>Built-in variables may be used by enclosing them in percent signs (for example, <code>#Include "%A_ScriptDir%"</code>). Percent signs which are not part of a valid variable reference are interpreted literally. All built-in variables are valid, except for <a href="../Variables.htm#Args">A_Args</a> and built-in classes.</p>
  <p>Known limitation: When compiling a script, variables are evaluated by the compiler and may differ from what the script would return when it is finally executed. The following variables are supported: <a href="../Variables.htm#AhkPath">A_AhkPath</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#AppData">A_AppData</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#AppDataCommon">A_AppDataCommon</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ComputerName">A_ComputerName</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ComSpec">A_ComSpec</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Desktop">A_Desktop</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#DesktopCommon">A_DesktopCommon</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#IsCompiled">A_IsCompiled</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#LineFile">A_LineFile</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#MyDocuments">A_MyDocuments</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ProgramFiles">A_ProgramFiles</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Programs">A_Programs</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ProgramsCommon">A_ProgramsCommon</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ScriptDir">A_ScriptDir</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ScriptFullPath">A_ScriptFullPath</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ScriptName">A_ScriptName</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Space">A_Space</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#StartMenu">A_StartMenu</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#StartMenuCommon">A_StartMenuCommon</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Startup">A_Startup</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#StartupCommon">A_StartupCommon</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Tab">A_Tab</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Temp">A_Temp</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#UserName">A_UserName</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#WinDir">A_WinDir</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>File:</strong> The name of the file to be included. By default, relative paths are relative to the directory of the file which contains the #Include directive. This default can be overridden by using <code>#Include Dir</code> as described below. Note: <a href="SetWorkingDir.htm">SetWorkingDir</a> has no effect on #Include because #Include is processed before the script begins executing.</p>
    <p><strong>Directory:</strong> Specify a directory instead of a file to change the working directory used by all subsequent occurrences of #Include and <a href="FileInstall.htm">FileInstall</a> in the current file. Note: Changing the working directory in this way does not affect the script's initial working directory when it starts running (<a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a>). To change that, use <a href="SetWorkingDir.htm">SetWorkingDir</a> at the top of the script.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This parameter is not an expression, but can be enclosed in quote marks (either 'single' or "double").</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>LibName</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>A library file or function name. For example, <code>#include &lt;lib&gt;</code> and <code>#include &lt;lib_func&gt;</code> would both include lib.ahk from one of the <a href="../Scripts.htm#lib">Lib folders</a>. <em>LibName</em> cannot contain variable references.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A script behaves as though the included file's contents are physically present at the exact position of the #Include directive (as though a copy-and-paste were done from the included file). Consequently, it generally cannot merge two isolated scripts together into one functioning script.</p>
<p>#Include ensures that <em>FileName</em> is included only once, even if multiple inclusions are encountered for it. By contrast, #IncludeAgain allows multiple inclusions of the same file, while being the same as #Include in all other respects.</p>
<p>The <em>FileName</em> parameter may optionally be preceded by <code>*i</code> and a single space, which causes the program to ignore any failure to read the included file. For example: <code>#Include "*i SpecialOptions.ahk"</code>. This option should be used only when the included file's contents are not essential to the main script's operation.</p>
<p>Lines displayed in the main window via <a href="ListLines.htm">ListLines</a> or the menu View-&gt;Lines are always numbered according to their physical order within their own files. In other words, including a new file will change the line numbering of the main script file by only one line, namely that of the #Include line itself (except for <a href="../Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">compiled scripts</a>, which merge their included files into one big script at the time of compilation).</p>
<p>#Include is often used to load <a href="../Functions.htm">functions</a> defined in an external file.</p>
<p>Like other directives, #Include cannot be executed conditionally. In other words, this example would not work as expected:</p>
<pre>if (x = 1)
    #Include "SomeFile.ahk"  <em>; This line takes effect regardless of the value of x.</em></pre>

<h2 id="General_Remarks">General Remarks</h2>
<p>For an explanation of how SendLevel and #InputLevel are used, see <a href="SendLevel.htm">SendLevel</a>.</p>
<p>This directive is positional: it affects all hotkeys and hotstrings between it and the next #InputLevel directive. If not specified by an #InputLevel directive, hotkeys and hotstrings default to level 0.</p>
<p>A hotkey's input level can also be set using the Hotkey function. For example: <code>Hotkey "#z", my_hotkey_sub, "<strong>I1</strong>"</code></p>
<p>The input level of a hotkey or non-auto-replace hotstring is also used as the default <a href="SendLevel.htm">send level</a> for any keystrokes or button clicks generated by that hotkey or hotstring. Since a keyboard or mouse <a href="../misc/Remap.htm">remapping</a> is actually a pair of hotkeys, this allows #InputLevel to be used to allow remappings to trigger other hotkeys.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey versions older than v1.1.06 behave as though <code>#InputLevel 0</code> and <code>SendLevel 0</code> are in effect.</p>
<p>Like other directives, #InputLevel cannot be executed conditionally.</p>

  <dt>Setting</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify one of the following literal values (if omitted, it defaults to <em>True</em>):</p>
    <p><strong>True</strong> or <strong>1</strong>: All hotkey subroutines between here and the next <code>#MaxThreadsBuffer False</code> directive will buffer rather than ignore presses of their hotkeys whenever their subroutines are at their <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> limit.</p>
    <p><strong>False</strong> or <strong>0</strong>: This is the default behavior. A hotkey press will be ignored whenever that hotkey is already running its maximum number of threads (usually 1, but this can be changed with <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a>).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This directive is rarely used because this type of buffering, which is OFF by default, usually does more harm than good. For example, if you accidentally press a hotkey twice, having this setting ON would cause that hotkey's subroutine to automatically run a second time if its first <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> takes less than 1 second to finish (this type of buffer expires after 1 second, by design). Note that AutoHotkey  buffers hotkeys in several other ways (such as <code><a href="Thread.htm">Thread</a> "Interrupt"</code> and <code><a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a></code>). It's just that this particular way can be detrimental, thus it is OFF by default.</p>
<p>The main use for this directive is to increase the responsiveness of the keyboard's auto-repeat feature. For example, when you hold down a hotkey whose <a href="_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> setting is 1 (the default), incoming keypresses  are ignored if that hotkey subroutine is already running. Thus, when the subroutine finishes, it must wait for the next auto-repeat keypress to come in, which might take 50ms or more due to being caught in between keystrokes of the auto-repeat cycle. This 50ms delay can be avoided by enabling this directive for any hotkey that needs the best possible response time while it is being auto-repeated.</p>
<p>As with all # directives, this one should not be positioned in the script as though it were a function (i.e. it is not necessary to have it contained within a subroutine). Instead, position it immediately before the first hotkey you wish to have affected by it.</p>
<p>Like other directives, #MaxThreadsBuffer cannot be executed conditionally.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This setting is used to control how many "instances" of a given <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> or <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstring</a> subroutine are allowed to exist simultaneously. For example, if a hotkey has a max of 1 and it is pressed again while its subroutine is already running, the press will be ignored. This is helpful to prevent accidental double-presses. However, if you wish  these keypresses to be buffered rather than ignored -- perhaps to increase the responsiveness of the keyboard's auto-repeat feature --  use <a href="_MaxThreadsBuffer.htm">#MaxThreadsBuffer</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="_MaxThreads.htm">#MaxThreads</a>, this setting is <strong>not</strong> global. Instead, position it before the first hotkey you wish to have affected by it, which will result in all subsequent hotkeys using that value until another instance of this directive is encountered.</p>
<p>The setting of <a href="_MaxThreads.htm">#MaxThreads</a> -- if lower than this setting -- takes precedence.</p>
<p>If this directive is unspecified in the script, it will behave as though set to 1.</p>

<h1>#NoTrayIcon</h1>

<p>Disables the showing of a <a href="../Program.htm#tray-icon">tray icon</a>.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">#NoTrayIcon</span></pre>
<p>Specifying this anywhere in a script will prevent the showing of a tray icon for that script when it is launched (even if the script is compiled into an EXE).</p>
<p>If you use this for a script that has hotkeys, you might want to bind a hotkey to the <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> function. Otherwise, there will be no easy way to exit the program (without restarting the computer or killing the process). For example: <code>#x::ExitApp</code>.</p>
<p>The tray icon can be made to disappear or reappear at any time during the execution of the script by assigning a true or false value to <a href="../Variables.htm#IconHidden">A_IconHidden</a>. The only drawback of using <code><a href="../Variables.htm#IconHidden">A_IconHidden</a> := true</code> at the very top of the script is that the tray icon might be briefly visible when the script is first launched.

<h1>#Requires</h1>

<p>Displays an error and quits if a version requirement is not met.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">#Requires</span> Requirement</pre>

<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Requirement</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this does not begin with the word "AutoHotkey", an error message is shown and the program exits. This encourages clarity and reserves the directive for future uses. Other forks of AutoHotkey may support other names.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, the word "AutoHotkey" should be followed by any combination of the following, separated by spaces or tabs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An optional letter "v" followed by a version number. <a href="../Variables.htm#AhkVersion">A_AhkVersion</a> is required to be greater than or equal to this version, but less than the next major version.</li>
      <li>One of <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> or <code>=</code> immediately followed by an optional letter "v" and a version number. For example, <code class="no-highlight">&gt;=2-rc &lt;2</code> allows v2 release candidates but not the final release.</li>
      <li>One of the following words to restrict the type of executable (EXE) which can run the script: "32-bit", "64-bit".</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Error_Message">Error Message</h2>
<p>The message shown depends on the version of AutoHotkey interpreting the directive.</p>
<p>For v2, the path, version and build of AutoHotkey are always shown in the error message.</p>
<p>If the script is launched with a version of AutoHotkey that does not support this directive, the error message is something like the following:</p>
<pre class="no-highlight">Line Text: #Requires <i>%Requirement%</i>
Error: This line does not contain a recognized action.</pre>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>If the script uses syntax or functions which are unavailable in earlier versions, using this directive ensures that the error message shows the unmet requirement, rather than indicating an arbitrary syntax error. This cannot be done with something like <code>if (A_AhkVersion &lt;= "1.1.33")</code> because a syntax error elsewhere in the script would prevent it from executing.</p>
<p>When sharing a script or posting code online, using this directive allows anyone who finds the code to readily identify which version of AutoHotkey it was intended for.</p>
<p>Other programs or scripts can check for this directive for various purposes. For example, the launcher installed with AutoHotkey v2 uses it to determine which AutoHotkey executable to launch, while a script editor or related tools might use it to determine how to interpret or highlight the script file.</p>
<p id="compare">Version strings are compared as a series of dot-delimited components, optionally followed by a hyphen and pre-release identifier(s).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Numeric components are compared numerically. For example, v1.01 = v1.1, but a20 &gt; a112.</li>
  <li>Numeric components are always considered lower than non-numeric components in the same position.</li>
  <li>Any missing dot-delimited components are assumed to be zero. For example, v1.1.33-alpha is the same as v1.1.33.00-alpha.0.</li>
  <li>Non-numeric components are compared alphabetically, and are case sensitive.</li>
  <li>Pre-release versions are considered lower than standard releases. For example, a script that <code>#Requires AutoHotkey v2</code> will not run on v2.0-a112. To permit pre-release versions, include a hyphen suffix. For example: <code class="no-highlight">v2.0-</code>.</li>
  <li>Any suffix beginning with "+" is ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p>A trailing "+" is sufficient to indicate to the reader that later versions are acceptable, but is not required.</p>
<p>Like other directives, #Requires cannot be executed conditionally.</p>

    <p>If the parameter is omitted, it defaults to <em>Force</em>. To change this behavior, specify one of the following words:</p>
    <p><strong>Force:</strong> Skips the dialog box and replaces the old instance automatically, which is similar in effect to the <a href="Reload.htm">Reload</a> function.</p>
    <p><strong>Ignore:</strong> Skips the dialog box and leaves the old instance running. In other words, attempts to launch an already-running script are ignored.</p>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Displays a dialog box asking whether to keep the old instance or replace it with the new one. This is the default behaviour if this directive is not used.</p>
    <p><strong>Off:</strong> Allows multiple instances of the script to run concurrently.</p>
  </dd>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>This directive is ignored when any of the following <a href="../Scripts.htm#cmd">command line switches</a> are used: /force /restart</p>
<p>Like other directives, #SingleInstance cannot be executed conditionally.</p>

<h2 id="Limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Previous instances of the script are identified by searching for a <a href="../Program.htm#main-window">main window</a> with the <a href="../Program.htm#title">default title</a>. Therefore, a previous instance may not be found if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The title of its main window has been changed.</li>
  <li>It is running on a different version of AutoHotkey.</li>
  <li>Its main window is no longer top-level, such as if the script has used <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setparent">SetParent</a> to change its parent to something other than NULL (0).</li>
</ul>
<p>At most one previous instance is detected and sent a message asking it to close. Therefore, the following additional limitations also apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If there are multiple instances (such as if previous instances of the script used the <code>#SingleInstance Off</code> mode), the topmost matching instance is sent the message, and other instances are not considered.</li>
  <li>If the previous instance is running at a higher integrity level than the new instance (where running as administrator &gt; <a href="../Program.htm#Installer_uiAccess">running with UI access</a> &gt; normal), it cannot be closed due to security restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If multiple instances of the script are started simultaneously, they may fail to detect each other or may all target the same previous instance. This would result in multiple instances of the script starting.</p>

  <dt>Setting</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify one of the following literal values (if omitted, it defaults to <em>True</em>):</p>
    <p><strong>True</strong> or <strong>1</strong>: The <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard hook</a> will be used to implement all keyboard hotkeys between here and the next <code>#UseHook false</code> (if any).</p>
    <p><strong>False</strong> or <strong>0</strong>: Hotkeys will be implemented using the default method (RegisterHotkey() if possible; otherwise, the keyboard hook).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Normally, the windows API function RegisterHotkey() is used to implement a keyboard hotkey whenever possible. However, the responsiveness of hotkeys might be better under some conditions if the <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard hook</a> is used instead.</p>
<p>Turning this directive ON is equivalent to using the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#prefixdollar">$ prefix</a> in the definition of each affected hotkey.</p>
<p>As with all # directives -- which are processed only once when the script is launched --  <code>#UseHook</code> should not be positioned in the script as though it were a function (that is, it is not necessary to have it contained within a subroutine). Instead, position it immediately before the first hotkey you wish to have affected by it.</p>
<p>By default, hotkeys that use the <a href="InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard hook</a> cannot be triggered by means of the <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> function. Similarly, mouse hotkeys cannot be triggered by built-in functions such as <a href="Click.htm">Click</a> because all mouse hotkeys use the <a href="InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse hook</a>. One workaround is to <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Function">name the hotkey's function</a> and call it directly.</p>
<p><a href="_InputLevel.htm">#InputLevel</a> and <a href="SendLevel.htm">SendLevel</a> provide additional control over which hotkeys and hotstrings are triggered by the Send function.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>As the target of a direct, non-dynamic assignment such as <code>MyVar := ""</code>.</li>

    </ul>
    <p id="LocalSameAsGlobal"><strong>LocalSameAsGlobal</strong>: Before the script starts to run, display a warning for each <em>undeclared</em> local variable which has the same name as a global variable. This is intended to prevent errors caused by forgetting to declare a global variable inside a function before attempting to assign to it. If the variable really was intended to be local, a declaration such as <code>local x</code> or <code>static y</code> can be used to suppress the warning.</p>
    <p>This warning is disabled by default.</p>
    <pre>#Warn

    <p id="Unreachable"><strong>Unreachable</strong>: Before the script starts to run, show a warning for each line that immediately follows a <code>Return</code>, <code>Break</code>, <code>Continue</code>, <code>Throw</code> or <code>Goto</code> at the same nesting level, unless that line is the target of a label. Any such line would never be executed.</p>
    <p>If the code is intended to be unreachable - such as if a <code>return</code> has been used to temporarily disable a block of code, or a hotkey or hotstring has been temporarily disabled by commenting it out - consider commenting out the unreachable code as well. Alternatively, the warning can be suppressed by defining a <a href="../misc/Labels.htm">label</a> above the first unreachable line.</p>
    <p><strong>All</strong>: Apply the given <em>WarningMode</em> to all supported warning types.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>WarningMode</dt>

    <p>A value indicating how warnings should be delivered. If omitted, it defaults to <em>MsgBox</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>MsgBox</strong>: Show a message box describing the warning. Note that once the message box is dismissed, the script will continue as usual.</p>
    <p><strong>StdOut</strong>: Send a description of the warning to <em>stdout</em> (the program's standard output stream), along with the filename and line number. This allows fancy editors such as SciTE to capture warnings without disrupting the script - the user can later jump to each offending line via the editor's output pane.</p>
    <p><strong>OutputDebug</strong>: Send a description of the warning to the debugger for display. If a debugger is not active, this will have no effect. For more details, see <a href="OutputDebug.htm">OutputDebug</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Off</strong>: Disable warnings of the given <em>WarningType</em>.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
	<p>By default, all warnings are enabled and use the MsgBox mode, except for LocalSameAsGlobal, which is disabled.</p>
<p>The checks which produce VarUnset, LocalSameAsGlobal and Unreachable warnings are performed after all directives have been parsed, but before the script executes. Therefore, the location in the script is not significant (and, like other directives, #Warn cannot be executed conditionally).</p>
<p>However, the ordering of multiple #Warn directives is significant: the last occurrence that sets a given warning determines the mode for that warning.  So, for example, the two statements below have the combined effect of enabling all warnings except LocalSameAsGlobal:</p>

#Warn LocalSameAsGlobal, Off

<h2 id="Intro1">Introduction</h2>
<p>Script compiler directives allow the user to specify details of how a script is to be compiled via <a href="../Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">Ahk2Exe</a>. Some of the features are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ability to change the version information (such as the name, description, version...).</li>
  <li>Ability to add resources to the compiled script.</li>
  <li>Ability to tweak several miscellaneous aspects of compilation.</li>
  <li>Ability to remove code sections from the compiled script and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>The script compiler looks for special comments in the source script and recognises these as Compiler Directives. All compiler directives are introduced by the string <code>@Ahk2Exe-</code>, preceded by the comment flag (usually <code>;</code>).</p>

<h2 id="IgnoreKeep">Directives that control the script behaviour</h2>
<p>It is possible to remove code sections from the compiled script by wrapping them in directives:</p>
<pre class="NoIndent">MsgBox "This message appears in both the compiled and uncompiled script"
<em>;@Ahk2Exe-IgnoreBegin</em>
MsgBox "This message does NOT appear in the compiled script"
<em>;@Ahk2Exe-IgnoreEnd</em>
MsgBox "This message appears in both the compiled and uncompiled script"
</pre>
<p>The reverse is also possible, i.e. marking a code section to only be executed in the compiled script:</p>
<pre class="NoIndent"><em>/*@Ahk2Exe-Keep
MsgBox "This message appears only in the compiled script"
*/</em>
MsgBox "This message appears in both the compiled and uncompiled script"
</pre>
<p>This has advantage over <a href="../Variables.htm#IsCompiled">A_IsCompiled</a> because the code is completely removed from the compiled script during preprocessing, thus making the compiled script smaller. The reverse is also true: it will not be necessary to check for <a href="../Variables.htm#IsCompiled">A_IsCompiled</a> because the code is inside a comment block in the uncompiled script.</p>

<h2 id="Directives">Directives that control executable metadata</h2>
<h3 id="Intro2">Introduction</h3>
<p>In the parameters of these directives, the following escape sequences are supported: <code>``</code>, <code>`,</code>, <code>`n</code>, <code>`r</code> and <code>`t</code>. Commas <em>always</em> need to be escaped, regardless of the parameter position. "Integer" refers to unsigned 16-bit integers (0..0xFFFF).</p>

<p>If required, directive parameters can reference the following list of standard built-in variables by enclosing the variable name with <code>%</code> signs:</p>
<p id="group1"><strong>Group 1:</strong> <a href="../Variables.htm#AhkPath">A_AhkPath</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#AppData">A_AppData</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#AppDataCommon">A_AppDataCommon</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ComputerName">A_ComputerName</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ComSpec">A_ComSpec</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Desktop">A_Desktop</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#DesktopCommon">A_DesktopCommon</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#MyDocuments">A_MyDocuments</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ProgramFiles">A_ProgramFiles</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Programs">A_Programs</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ProgramsCommon">A_ProgramsCommon</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ScriptDir">A_ScriptDir</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ScriptFullPath">A_ScriptFullPath</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ScriptName">A_ScriptName</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Space">A_Space</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#StartMenu">A_StartMenu</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#StartMenuCommon">A_StartMenuCommon</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Startup">A_Startup</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#StartupCommon">A_StartupCommon</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Tab">A_Tab</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Temp">A_Temp</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#UserName">A_UserName</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#WinDir">A_WinDir</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Group 2:</strong> <a href="../Variables.htm#AhkVersion">A_AhkVersion</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#IsCompiled">A_IsCompiled</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#PtrSize">A_PtrSize</a>.</p>

<p id="WorkFileName">In addition to these variable names, the special variable <strong>A_WorkFileName</strong> holds the temporary name of the processed .exe file. This can be used to pass the file name as a parameter to any <a href="#PostExec">PostExec</a> directives which need to access the generated .exe.</p>

<p id="BasePath">Furthermore, the special variable <strong>A_BasePath</strong> contains the full path and name of the selected base file.</p>

<p id="PriorLine">Also, the special variable <strong>A_PriorLine</strong> contains the source line immediately preceding the current compiler directive. Intervening lines of blanks and comments only are ignored, as are any intervening compiler directive lines. This variable can be used to 'pluck' constant information from the script source, and use it in later compiler directives. An example would be accessing the version number of the script, which may be changed often. Accessing the version number in this way means that it needs to be changed only once in the source code, and the change will get copied through to the necessary directive. (See the RegEx example below for more information.)</p>

<p>As well, special user variables can be created with the format <code>U_<i>Name</i></code> using the <a href="#Let">Let</a> and <a href="#Obey">Obey</a> directives, described below.</p>

<p>In addition to being available for directive parameters, all variables can be accessed from any RT_MENU, RT_DIALOG, RT_STRING, RT_ACCELERATORS, RT_HTML, and RT_MANIFEST file supplied to the <a href="#AddResource">AddResource</a> directive, below.</p>

<p>If needed, the value returned from the above variables can be manipulated by including at the end of the built-in variable name before the ending <code>%</code>, up to 2 parameters (called p2 and p3) all separated by tilde <code>~</code>. The p2 and p3 parameters will be used as literals in the 2nd and 3rd parameters of a <a href="../lib/RegExReplace.htm">RegExReplace</a> function to manipulate the value returned. (See <a href="RegEx-QuickRef.htm">RegEx Quick Reference</a>.) Note that p3 is optional.</p>

<p>To include a tilde as data in p2 or p3, preceded it with a back-tick, i.e. <code>`~</code>. To include a back-tick character as data in p2 or p3, double it, i.e. <code>``</code>.</p>

<strong>RegEx examples:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>
    <pre class="NoIndent">%A_ScriptName~\.[^\.]+$~.exe%</pre>
    <p>This replaces the extension plus preceding full-stop, with <code>.exe</code> in the actual script name.<br>(<code>\.[^\.]+$~.exe</code> means scan for a <code>.</code> followed by 1 or more non-<code>.</code> characters followed by end-of-string, and replace them with <code>.exe</code>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assume there is a source line followed by two compiler directives as follows:</p>
    <pre>CodeVersion := "1.2.3.4", company := "My Company"</pre>
    <pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-Let U_version = %A_PriorLine~U)^(.+"){1}(.+)".*$~$2%</em></pre>
    <pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-Let U_company = %A_PriorLine~U)^(.+"){3}(.+)".*$~$2%</em></pre>
    <p>These directives copy the version number <code>1.2.3.4</code> into the special variable <code>U_version</code>, and the company name <code>My Company</code> into the special variable <code>U_company</code> for use in other directives later.<br>
    (The <code>{1}</code> in the first regex was changed to <code>{3}</code> in the second regex to select after the third <code>"</code> to extract the company name.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other examples:</strong> Other working examples which can be downloaded and examined, are available from <a href="https://github.com/AutoHotkey/Ahk2Exe/releases/tag/DemoCode_1">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="AddResource">AddResource</h3>
<p>Adds a resource to the compiled executable. (Also see <a href="#UseResourceLang">UseResourceLang</a> below)</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-AddResource</span> FileName <span class="optional">, ResourceName</span></pre>
<dl>
  <dt>FileName</dt>
  <dd>The filename of the resource to add. The file is assumed to be in (or relative to) the script's own directory if an absolute path isn't specified. The type of the resource (as an integer or string) can be explicitly specified by prepending an asterisk to it: <code class="no-highlight">*type Filename</code>. If omitted, Ahk2Exe automatically detects the type according to the file extension.</dd>
  <dt>ResourceName</dt>
  <dd><i>(Optional)</i> The name that the resource will have (can be a string or an integer). If omitted, it defaults to the name (with no path) of the file, in uppercase.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is a list of common standard resource types and the extensions that trigger them by default.</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 (RT_BITMAP): <code>.bmp</code>, <code>.dib</code></li>
  <li>4 (RT_MENU)</li>
  <li>5 (RT_DIALOG)</li>
  <li>6 (RT_STRING)</li>
  <li>9 (RT_ACCELERATORS)</li>
  <li>10 (RT_RCDATA): Every single other extension.</li>
  <li>11 (RT_MESSAGETABLE)</li>
  <li>12 (RT_GROUP_CURSOR): <code>.cur</code> (not yet supported)</li>
  <li>14 (RT_GROUP_ICON): <code>.ico</code></li>
  <li>23 (RT_HTML): <code>.htm</code>, <code>.html</code>, <code>.mht</code></li>
  <li>24 (RT_MANIFEST): <code>.manifest</code>. If the name for the resource is not specified, it defaults to <code>1</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> To replace the standard icons (other than the <a href="#SetMainIcon">main icon</a>):</p>
<pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-AddResource Icon1.ico, 160  ; Replaces 'H on blue'
;@Ahk2Exe-AddResource Icon2.ico, 206  ; Replaces 'S on green'
;@Ahk2Exe-AddResource Icon3.ico, 207  ; Replaces 'H on red'
;@Ahk2Exe-AddResource Icon4.ico, 208  ; Replaces 'S on red'</em></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> To include another script as a separate RCDATA resource (see <a href="../Program.htm#embedded-scripts">Embedded Scripts</a>):</p>
<pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-AddResource MyScript1.ahk, #2
;@Ahk2Exe-AddResource MyScript2.ahk, MYRESOURCE</em></pre>
<p>Note that each script added with this directive will be fully and separately processed by the compiler, and can include further directives. If there are any competing directives overall, the last encountered by the compiler will be used.</p>

<h3 id="Bin">Bin / Base</h3>
<p>Specifies the base version of AutoHotkey to be used to generate the .exe file. This directive may be overridden by a base file parameter specified in the GUI or CLI. This directive can be specified many times if necessary, but only in the top level script file (i.e. not in an <a href="../lib/_Include.htm">#Include</a> file). The compiler will be run at least once for each Bin/Base directive found. (If an actual comment is appended to this directive, it must use the <code> ;</code> flag. To truly comment out this directive, insert a space after the first comment flag.)</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-Bin </span> [Path\]Name <span class="optional">, [Exe_path\][Name], Codepage</span> <em>; Deprecated</em>
<span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-Base</span> [Path\]Name <span class="optional">, [Exe_path\][Name], Codepage</span></pre>
<dl>
  <dt>[Path\]Name</dt>
  <dd>The *.bin or *.exe file to use. If no extension is supplied, <code>.bin</code> is assumed. The file is assumed to be in (or relative to) the compiler's own directory if an absolute path isn't specified. A DOS mask may be specified for <em>Name</em>, e.g. <code>ANSI*</code>, <code>Unicode 32*</code>, <code>Unicode 64*</code>, or <code>*bit</code> for all three. The compiler will be run for each *.bin or *.exe file that matches. Any use of built-in variable replacements must only be from <a href="#group1">group 1</a> above.</dd>
  <dt>[Exe_path\][Name]</dt>
  <dd><i>(Optional)</i> The file name to be given to the .exe. Any extension supplied will be replaced by <code>.exe</code>. If no path is specified, the .exe will be created in the script folder. If no name is specified, the .exe will have the default name. (This parameter can be overridden by the <a href="#ExeName">ExeName</a> directive.)</dd>
  <dt>Codepage</dt>
  <dd><i>(Optional)</i> Overrides the default <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/intl/code-page-identifiers">codepage</a>
  used to process script files. (Scripts should begin with a Unicode byte-order-mark (BOM), rendering the use of this parameter unnecessary.)</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="ConsoleApp">ConsoleApp</h3>
<p>Changes the executable subsystem to Console mode.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-ConsoleApp</span></pre>

<h3 id="Cont">Cont</h3>
<p>Specifies a continuation line for the preceding directive. This allows a long-lined directive to be formatted so that it is easy to read in the source code.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-Cont</span> Text</pre>
<dl>
  <dt>Text</dt>
  <dd>The text to be appended to the previous directive line, before that line is processed. The text starts after the single space following the <code>Cont</code> key-word.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Debug">Debug</h3>
<p>Shows a message box with the supplied text, for debugging purposes.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-Debug</span> Text</pre>
<dl>
  <dt>Text</dt>
  <dd>The text to be shown. Include any special variables between <code>%</code> signs to see the (manipulated) contents.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="ExeName">ExeName</h3>
<p>Specifies the location and name given to the generated .exe file. (Also see the <a href="#Bin">Base</a> directive.) This directive may be overridden by an output file specified in the GUI or CLI.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-ExeName</span> [Path\][Name]</pre>
<dl>
  <dt>[Path\][Name]</dt>
  <dd>The .exe file name. Any extension supplied will be replaced by <code>.exe</code>. If no path is specified, the .exe will be created in the script folder. If no name is specified, the .exe will have the default name.</dd>
</dl>
<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-Obey U_bits, = %A_PtrSize% * 8
;@Ahk2Exe-Obey U_type, = "%A_IsUnicode%" ? "Unicode" : "ANSI"
;@Ahk2Exe-ExeName %A_ScriptName~\.[^\.]+$%_%U_type%_%U_bits%</em></pre>

<h3 id="Let">Let</h3>
<p>Creates (or modifies) one or more user variables which can be accessed by <code>%U_<i>Name</i>%</code>, similar to the built-in variables (see above).</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-Let</span> Name = Value <span class="optional">, Name = Value, ...</span></pre>
<dl>
  <dt>Name</dt>
  <dd>The name of the variable (with or without the leading <code>U_</code>).</dd>
  <dt>Value</dt>
  <dd>The value to be used.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Nop">Nop</h3>
<p>Does nothing.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-Nop</span> <span class="optional">Text</span></pre>
<dl>
  <dt>Text</dt>
  <dd><i>(Optional)</i> Any text, which is ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre>Ver := A_AhkVersion "" <em>; If quoted literal not empty, do 'SetVersion'
;@Ahk2Exe-Obey U_V, = "%A_PriorLine~U)^(.+")(.*)".*$~$2%" ? "SetVersion" : "Nop"
;@Ahk2Exe-%U_V%        %A_AhkVersion%%A_PriorLine~U)^(.+")(.*)".*$~$2%</em></pre>

<h3 id="Obey">Obey</h3>
<p>Obeys isolated AutoHotkey commands or expressions, with result in <code>U_<i>Name</i></code>.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-Obey</span> Name, CmdOrExp <span class="optional">, Extra</span></pre>
<dl>
  <dt>Name</dt>
  <dd>The name of the variable (with or without the leading <code>U_</code>) to receive the result.</dd>
  <dt>CmdOrExp</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The command or expression to obey.</p>
    <p><strong>Command</strong> format must use <em>Name</em> as the output variable (often the first parameter), e.g.</p>
    <pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-Obey U_date, FormatTime U_date`, R D2 T2</em></pre>
    <p><strong>Expression</strong> format must start with <code>=</code>, e.g.</p>
    <pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-Obey U_type, = "%A_IsUnicode%" ? "Unicode" : "ANSI"</em></pre>
    <p>Expressions can be written in command format, e.g.</p>
    <pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-Obey U_bits, U_bits := %A_PtrSize% * 8</em></pre>
    <p>If needed, separate multiple commands and expressions with <code>`n</code>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Extra</dt>
  <dd><i>(Optional)</i> A number (1-9) specifying the number of extra results to be returned. e.g. if extra = 2, results will be returned in <code>U_<i>name</i></code>, <code>U_<i>name</i>1</code>, and <code>U_<i>name</i>2</code>. The values in the <code><i>name</i></code>s must first be set by the expression or command.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="PostExec">PostExec</h3>
<p>Specifies a program to be executed after a successful compilation, before (or after) any <a href="../Scripts.htm#mpress">Compression</a> is applied to the .exe. This directive can be present many times and will be executed in the order encountered by the compiler, in the appropriate queue as specified by the <em>When</em> parameter.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-PostExec</span> Program [parameters] <span class="optional">, When, WorkingDir, Hidden, IgnoreErrors</span></pre>
<dl>
  <dt>Program [parameters]</dt>
  <dd>The program to execute, plus parameters. To allow access to the processed .exe file, specify the special variable <a href="#WorkFileName">A_WorkFileName</a> as a quoted parameter, such as <code>"%A_WorkFileName%"</code>. If the program changes the .exe, the altered .exe must be moved back to the input file specified by <code>%A_WorkFileName%</code>, by the program. (Note that the .exe will contain binary data.)</dd>
  <dt>When</dt>
  <dd>
    <p><i>(Optional)</i> Leave blank to execute before any <a href="../Scripts.htm#mpress">Compression</a> is done. Otherwise set to a number to run after compression as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>0 - Only run when no compression is specified.</li>
      <li>1 - Only run when MPRESS compression is specified.</li>
      <li>2 - Only run when UPX compression is specified.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>WorkingDir</dt>
  <dd><i>(Optional)</i> The working directory for the program. Do not enclose the name in double quotes even if it contains spaces. If omitted, the directory of the compiler (Ahk2Exe) will be used.</dd>
  <dt>Hidden</dt>
  <dd><i>(Optional)</i> If set to 1, the program will be launched hidden.</dd>
  <dt>IgnoreErrors</dt>
  <dd><i>(Optional)</i> If set to 1, any errors that occur during the launching or running of the program will not be reported to the user.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> (To use the first two examples, first download <a href="https://github.com/AutoHotkey/Ahk2Exe/blob/master/BinMod.ahk">BinMod.ahk</a> and compile it according to the instructions in the downloaded script.)</p>
<p>This example can be used to remove a reference to "AutoHotkey" in the generated .exe to disguise that it is a compiled AutoHotkey script:</p>
<pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-Obey U_au, = "%A_IsUnicode%" ? 2 : 1    ; Script ANSI or Unicode?
;@Ahk2Exe-PostExec "BinMod.exe" "%A_WorkFileName%"
;@Ahk2Exe-Cont  "%U_au%2.&gt;AUTOHOTKEY SCRIPT&lt;. DATA              "</em></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> This example will alter a UPX compressed .exe so that it can't be de-compressed with <code>UPX -d</code>:</p>
<pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-PostExec "BinMod.exe" "%A_WorkFileName%"
;@Ahk2Exe-Cont  "11.UPX." "1.UPX!.", 2</em></pre>
<p>(There are other examples mentioned in the <a href="https://github.com/AutoHotkey/Ahk2Exe/blob/master/BinMod.ahk">BinMod.ahk</a> script.)</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> This example specifies the <a href="../Scripts.htm#mpress">Compression</a> to be used on a compiled script, if none is specified in the CLI or GUI. The default parameters normally used by the compiler are shown.</p><p>For MPRESS:</p>
<pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-PostExec "MPRESS.exe" "%A_WorkFileName%" -q -x, 0,, 1</em></pre>
<p>For UPX:</p>
<pre><em>;@Ahk2Exe-PostExec "UPX.exe" "%A_WorkFileName%"
;@Ahk2Exe-Cont  -q --all-methods --compress-icons=0, 0,, 1</em></pre>

<h3 id="ResourceID">ResourceID</h3>
<p>Assigns a non-standard resource ID to be used for the main script for compilations which use an <a href="#Bin">.exe base file</a> (see <a href="../Program.htm#embedded-scripts">Embedded Scripts</a>). This directive may be overridden by a Resource ID specified in the GUI or CLI. This directive is ignored if it appears in a script inserted by the <a href="#AddResource">AddResource</a> directive.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-ResourceID</span> Name</pre>
<dl>
  <dt>Name</dt>
  <dd>The resource ID to use. Numeric resource IDs should consist of a hash sign (#) followed by a decimal number.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="SetMainIcon">SetMainIcon</h3>
<p>Overrides the custom EXE icon used for compilation. (To change the other icons, see the <a href="#AddResource">AddResource</a> example.) This directive may be overridden by an icon file specified in the GUI or CLI. The new icon might not be immediately visible in Windows Explorer if the compiled file existed before with a different icon, however the new icon can be shown by selecting <code>Refresh Windows Icons</code> from the Ahk2Exe <code>File</code> menu.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">;@Ahk2Exe-SetMainIcon</span> <span class="optional">IcoFile</span></pre>
<dl>
  <dt>IcoFile</dt>
  <dd><i>(Optional)</i> The icon file to use. If omitted, the default AutoHotkey icon is used.</dd>

<title>DPI Scaling | AutoHotkey v2</title>

<body>
<h1>DPI Scaling</h1>

<p>DPI scaling is a function performed either by the operating system or by the application, to increase the visual size of content proportionate to the "dots per inch" setting of the display. Generally it allows content to appear at the same physical size on systems with different display resolutions, or to at least be usable on very high-resolution displays. Sometimes a user may increase the DPI setting just to make content larger and more comfortable to read.</p>
<p><a href="../Variables.htm#ScreenDPI">A_ScreenDPI</a> returns the DPI setting of the primary screen.</p>
<p>There are two types of DPI scaling that relate to AutoHotkey: Gui DPI Scaling and OS DPI Scaling.</p>

<h2 id="Gui_DPI_Scaling">Gui DPI Scaling</h2>
<p>Automatic scaling is performed by the Gui and GuiControl methods/properties by default, so that GUI scripts with hard-coded positions, sizes and margins will tend to scale as appropriate on high DPI screens. If this interferes with the script, or if the script will do its own scaling, the automatic scaling can be disabled. For more details, see the <a href="../lib/Gui.htm#DPIScale">-DPIScale</a> option.</p>

<h2 id="OS_DPI_Scaling">OS DPI Scaling</h2>
<p>For applications which are not DPI-aware, the operating system automatically scales coordinates passed to and returned from certain system functions. This type of scaling affects AutoHotkey only on systems with multiple screens where not all screens have the same DPI setting.</p>

<h3 id="Per-Monitor_DPI_Awareness">Per-Monitor DPI Awareness</h3>
<p>On Windows 8.1 and later, secondary screens can have different DPI settings, and "per-monitor DPI-aware" applications are expected to scale their windows according to the DPI of whichever screen they are currently on, adapting dynamically when the window moves between screens.</p>
<p>For applications which are not per-monitor DPI-aware, the system performs bitmap scaling to allow windows to change sizes when they move between screens, and hides this from the application by reporting coordinates and sizes scaled to the global DPI setting that the application expects to have. For instance, on an 11 inch 4K screen, a GUI designed to display at 96 dpi (100%) would be almost impossible to use, whereas upscaling it by 200% would make it usable.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey is not designed to perform per-monitor scaling, and therefore has not been marked as per-monitor DPI-aware. This is a boon, for instance, when moving a GUI window between a large external screen with 100% DPI and a smaller screen with 200% DPI. However, automatic scaling does have negative implications.</p>
<p>In order of the system's automatic scaling to work, system functions such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-movewindow">MoveWindow</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getwindowrect">GetWindowRect</a> automatically scale the coordinates that they accept or return. When AutoHotkey uses these functions to work with external windows, this often produces unexpected results if the coordinates are not on the primary screen. To add further confusion, some functions scale coordinates based on which screen the script's last active window was displayed on.</p>

<h2 id="Workarounds">Workarounds</h2>
<p>On Windows 10 version 1607 and later, the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setthreaddpiawarenesscontext">SetThreadDpiAwarenessContext</a> system function can be used to change the program's DPI awareness setting at runtime. For instance, enabling per-monitor DPI awareness disables the scaling performed by the system, so built-in functions such as <a href="../lib/WinMove.htm">WinMove</a> and <a href="../lib/WinGetPos.htm">WinGetPos</a> will accept or return coordinates in pixels, untouched by DPI scaling. However, if a GUI is sized for a screen with 100% DPI and then moved to a screen with 200% DPI, it will not adjust automatically, and may be very hard to use.</p>
<p>To enable per-monitor DPI awareness, call the following function prior to using functions that are normally affected by DPI scaling:</p>
<pre>DllCall("SetThreadDpiAwarenessContext", "ptr", -3, "ptr")</pre>
<p>On Windows 10 version 1703 and later, -3 can be replaced with -4 to enable the "Per Monitor v2" mode. This enables scaling of dialogs, menus, tooltips and some other things. However, it also causes the non-client area (title bar) to scale, which may cause the window's client area to be too small unless the script is designed to adjust for it (such as by responding to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/hidpi/wm-dpichanged">WM_DPICHANGED message</a>). This can be avoided by setting the context to -3 before creating the GUI, but -4 before creating any tooltips, menus or dialogs.</p>
<p>The thread's DPI awareness may temporarily change while the user is moving one of the script's windows, or while the script is displaying a dialog. Therefore, it is safest to set the DPI awareness immediately before using any functions which rely on it.</p>

<h3 id="Compiled_Scripts">Compiled Scripts</h3>
<p>Per-monitor DPI awareness can be enabled process-wide by changing the content of the <code>&lt;dpiAware&gt;</code> element of the compiled script's manifest resource from <code>true</code> (the default set in the base AutoHotkey executable file) to <code>true/pm</code>.</p>

<h1>Editors with AutoHotkey Support</h1>

<p>Any text editor can be used to edit an AutoHotkey script, but editors which are (or can be configured to be) more AutoHotkey-aware tend to make reading, editing and testing scripts much easier. AutoHotkey-aware editors may provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting, like what is used in this documentation. With syntax highlighting, words, symbols and segments of code are colour-coded to indicate their meaning. For instance, literal text, comments and variable names are displayed in different colours.</li>
  <li>Auto-complete, which typically offers a list of suggestions when you start typing the name of a known function or variable.</li>
  <li>Calltips may show you what the parameters are for a function while you are writing code to call the function.</li>
  <li><a href="../Scripts.htm#idebug">Interactive debugging</a>, such as to step through the script line by line and inspect variables at each step, or to view and modify variables or objects, beyond what <a href="../lib/ListVars.htm">ListVars</a> allows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SciTE4AutoHotkey is simple to install, relatively light-weight, and fully supports AutoHotkey v1 and v2 without further configuration.</li>
  <li>VS Code (plus extensions) provides an even higher level of support and a wider range of features, but can be heavy on resources.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="SciTE4AutoHotkey">SciTE4AutoHotkey</h2>
<p>SciTE4AutoHotkey is a custom version of the text editor known as SciTE. Its features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>Auto-complete</li>
  <li>Calltips</li>
  <li>Smart auto-indent</li>
  <li>Code folding</li>
  <li>Interactive debugging</li>
  <li>Running the script by pressing a hotkey</li>
  <li>Other tools for AutoHotkey scripting</li>
</ul>
<p>SciTE4AutoHotkey can be found here: <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/scite4ahk/">https://www.autohotkey.com/scite4ahk/</a></p>

<h2 id="Visual_Studio_Code_VS_Code">Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code can be configured with a high level of support for AutoHotkey by installing extensions.</p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp">AutoHotkey2 Language Support</a> provides many features, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>Auto-complete</li>
  <li>Calltips</li>
  <li>Smart auto-indent</li>
  <li>Code folding</li>
  <li>Running the script by pressing a hotkey</li>
  <li>Real-time diagnostics (detecting common errors)</li>
  <li>Formatting/tidying code</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This extension only supports AutoHotkey v2, but can also detect v1 scripts and automatically switch over to a v1 extension if one is installed.</li>
  <li>This extension can also be used with other editors, such as <b>vim</b>, <b>neovim</b> and <b>Sublime Text 4</b>. For details, see <a href="https://github.com/thqby/vscode-autohotkey2-lsp#use-in-other-editors">Use in other editors</a>.

<h1>Escape Sequences</h1>
<p>The escape character <code>`</code> (back-tick or grave accent) is used to indicate that the character immediately following it should be interpreted differently than it normally would. This character is at the upper left corner of most English keyboards.</p>
<p>In AutoHotkey the following escape sequences can be used:</p>

<table class="info">
  <tr>
    <th abbr="Seq">Sequence</th>
    <th>Result</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>``</code></td>
    <td><code>`</code> (literal accent; i.e. two consecutive escape characters result in a single literal character)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>`;</code></td>
    <td>
      <p><code class="no-highlight">;</code> (literal semicolon)</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> It is not necessary to escape a semicolon which has any character <u>other than</u> space or tab to its immediate left, since it would not be interpreted as a comment anyway.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>`:</code></td>
    <td><code>:</code> (literal colon). This is necessary only in a hotstring's triggering abbreviation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>`{</code></td>
    <td><kbd>{</kbd> (keyboard key). This is only valid, and is required, when <a href="Remap.htm#EscapeBrace">remapping</a> a key to <kbd>{</kbd>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>`n</code></td>
    <td>newline (linefeed/LF)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>`r</code></td>
    <td>carriage return (CR)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>`b</code></td>
    <td>backspace</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>`t</code></td>
    <td>tab (the more typical horizontal variety)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>`s</code></td>
    <td>space</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>`v</code></td>
    <td>vertical tab -- corresponds to Ascii value 11. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>`a</code></td>
    <td>alert (bell) -- corresponds to Ascii value 7. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>`f</code></td>
    <td>formfeed -- corresponds to Ascii value 12. It can also be manifest in some applications by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="quote">
    <td><code>`"</code> or <code>`'</code></td>
    <td>Single-quote marks (') and double-quote marks (") function identically, except that a string enclosed in single-quote marks can contain literal double-quote marks and vice versa. Therefore, to include an actual quote mark inside a literal string, escape the quote mark or enclose the string in the opposite type of quote mark. For example: <code>Var := "The color `"red`" was found."</code> or <code>Var := 'The color "red" was found.'</code>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h1>Function Objects</h1>

<p>"Function object" usually means any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <a href="../lib/Func.htm">Func</a> or <a href="../Functions.htm#closures">Closure</a> object, which represents an actual <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a>; either built-in or defined by the script.</li>
  <li>A user-defined object which can be called like a function.  This is sometimes also referred to as a "functor".</li>
  <li>Any other object which can be called like a function, such as a <a href="#BoundFunc">BoundFunc object</a> or a JavaScript function object returned by a COM method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Function objects can be used with the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../lib/CallbackCreate.htm">CallbackCreate</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/GuiOnEvent.htm">Gui events</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/For.htm">For ... in</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/HotIf.htm">HotIf</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/Hotstring.htm">Hotstring</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/InputHook.htm">InputHook</a> (OnEnd, OnChar, OnKeyDown, OnKeyUp)</li>
  <li><a href="../lib/Menu.htm#Add">Menu.Add</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/OnClipboardChange.htm">OnClipboardChange</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/OnError.htm">OnError</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/OnExit.htm">OnExit</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/OnMessage.htm">OnMessage</a></li>
  <li><a href="RegExCallout.htm">RegEx callouts</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/Sort.htm">Sort</a></li>
</ul>
<p id="HasCall">To determine whether an object appears to be callable, use one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Value.HasMethod()</code> works with all AutoHotkey values and objects by default, but allows HasMethod to be overridden for some objects or classes. For COM objects, this will typically fail (throw an exception or produce the wrong result) unless the COM object is actually an AutoHotkey object from another process.</li>
  <li><code>HasMethod(Value)</code> works with all AutoHotkey values and objects and cannot be overridden, but will return false if the presence of a <em>Call</em> method cannot be determined. An exception is thrown if <em>Value</em> is a <a href="../lib/ComObject.htm">ComObject</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="User-Defined">User-Defined</h2>
<!-- TODO: Explain how a user-defined object could be useful -->
<p>User-defined function objects must define a <em>Call</em> method containing the implementation of the "function".</p>
<pre>class YourClassName {
    Call(a, b) {  <em>; Declare parameters as needed, or an <a href="../Functions.htm#Variadic">array*</a>.</em>
        <em>;...</em>
        return c
    }
    <em>;...</em>
}
</pre>
<p>This applies to <em>instances</em> of <em>YourClassName</em>, such as the object returned by <code>YourClassName()</code>. Replacing <code>Call</code> with <code>static Call</code> would instead override what occurs when <em>YourClassName</em> itself is called.</p>
<h3 id="User-Defined-Examples">Examples</h3>
<p>The following example defines a function array which can be called; when called, it calls each element of the array in turn.</p>
<pre>class FuncArrayType extends Array {
    Call(params*) {
        <em>; Call a list of functions.</em>
        for fn in this
            fn(params*)
    }
}

<em>; Create an array of functions.</em>
funcArray := FuncArrayType()
<em>; Add some functions to the array (can be done at any point).</em>
funcArray.Push(One)
funcArray.Push(Two)
<em>; Create an object which uses the array as a method.</em>
obj := {method: funcArray}
<em>; Call the method (and consequently both One and Two).</em>
obj.method("2nd")
<em>; Call it as a function.</em>
(obj.method)("1st", "2nd")

One(param1, param2) {
    ListVars
    MsgBox
}
Two(param1, param2) {
    ListVars
    MsgBox
}</pre>

<h2 id="BoundFunc">BoundFunc Object</h2>
<p>Acts like a function, but just passes predefined parameters to another function.</p>
<p>There are two ways that BoundFunc objects can be created:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By calling the <a href="../lib/Func.htm#Bind">Func.Bind</a> method, which binds parameter values to a function.</li>
  <li>By calling the <a href="../lib/ObjBindMethod.htm">ObjBindMethod</a> function, which binds parameter values and a method name to a target object.</li>
</ul>
<p>BoundFunc objects can be called as shown in the example below. When the BoundFunc is called, it calls the function or method to which it is bound, passing a combination of bound parameters and the caller's parameters. Unbound parameter positions are assigned positions from the caller's parameter list, left to right. For example:</p>
<pre>fn := RealFn.Bind(1)  <em>; Bind first parameter only</em>
fn(2)      <em>; Shows "1, 2"</em>
fn.Call(3) <em>; Shows "1, 3"</em>

fn := RealFn.Bind( , 1)  <em>; Bind second parameter only</em>
fn(2)      <em>; Shows "2, 1"</em>
fn.Call(3) <em>; Shows "3, 1"</em>
fn(, 4)    <em>; Error: 'a' was omitted</em>

RealFn(a, b, c:="c") {
    MsgBox a ", " b
}</pre>
<p><a href="../lib/ObjBindMethod.htm">ObjBindMethod</a> can be used to bind to a method even when it isn't possible to retrieve a reference to the method itself.  For example:</p>
<pre>Shell := ComObject("Shell.Application")
RunBox := ObjBindMethod(Shell, "FileRun")
<em>; Show the Run dialog.</em>
RunBox</pre>
<p>For a more complex example, see <a href="../lib/SetTimer.htm#ExampleClass">SetTimer</a>.</p>
<p>Other properties and methods are inherited from <a href="../lib/Func.htm">Func</a>, but do not reflect the properties of the target function or method (which is not required to be implemented as a function). The BoundFunc acts as an anonymous variadic function with no other formal parameters, similar to the <a href="../Variables.htm#fat-arrow">fat arrow function</a> below:</p>
<pre>Func_Bind(fn, bound_args*) {
    return (args*) =&gt; (args.InsertAt(1, bound_args*), fn(args*))
}</pre>

<title>Image Handles - Syntax &amp; Usage | AutoHotkey v2</title>
<meta name="description" content="Image handles can be used in place of image filenames to use a bitmap or icon located in the memory." />
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

<body>
<h1>Image Handles</h1>

<p>To use an icon or bitmap handle in place of an image filename, use the following syntax:</p>
<pre class="Syntax">HBITMAP:<i>bitmap-handle</i>
HICON:<i>icon-handle</i></pre>
<p>Replace <em>bitmap-handle</em> or <em>icon-handle</em> with the actual handle value. For example, <code>"hicon:" handle</code>, where <em>handle</em> is a variable containing an icon handle.</p>
<p>The following things support this syntax:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../lib/GuiControls.htm#Picture">Gui.AddPicture</a> (and <a href="../lib/GuiControl.htm#Value">GuiCtrl.Value</a> when setting a Picture control's content).</li>
  <li><a href="../lib/ListView.htm#IL_Add">IL_Add</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/LoadPicture.htm">LoadPicture</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/GuiControls.htm#SB_SetIcon">SB.SetIcon</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/ImageSearch.htm">ImageSearch</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/TraySetIcon.htm">TraySetIcon</a> or <a href="../lib/Menu.htm#SetIcon">Menu.SetIcon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A bitmap or icon handle is a numeric value which identifies a bitmap or icon in memory. The majority of scripts never need to deal with handles, as in most cases AutoHotkey takes care of loading the image from file and freeing it when it is no longer needed. The syntax shown above is intended for use when the script obtains an icon or bitmap handle from another source, such as by sending the WM_GETICON message to a window. It can also be used in combination with <a href="../lib/LoadPicture.htm">LoadPicture</a> to avoid loading an image from file multiple times.</p>
<p>By default, AutoHotkey treats the handle as though it loaded the image from file - for example, a bitmap used on a Picture control is deleted when the GUI is destroyed, and an image will generally be deleted immediately if it needs to be resized. To avoid this, put an asterisk between the colon and handle. For example: <code>"hbitmap:*" handle</code>. With the exception of ImageSearch, this forces the function to take a copy of the image.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>
<div class="ex" id="ExHICON">
<p><a class="ex_number" href="#ExHICON"></a> Shows a menu of the first <em>n</em> files matching a pattern, and their icons.</p>
<pre>pattern := A_ScriptDir "\*"
n := 15

<em>; Create a menu.</em>
Fmenu := Menu()

<em>; Allocate memory for a SHFILEINFOW struct.</em>
fileinfo := Buffer(fisize := A_PtrSize + 688)

Loop Files, pattern, "FD"
{
    <em>; Add a menu item for each file.</em>
    Fmenu.Add A_LoopFileName, (*) =&gt; "" <em>; Do nothing.</em>
    
    <em>; Get the file's icon.</em>
    if DllCall("shell32\SHGetFileInfoW", "WStr", A_LoopFileFullPath
        , "UInt", 0, "Ptr", fileinfo, "UInt", fisize, "UInt", 0x100)
    {
        hicon := NumGet(fileinfo, 0, "Ptr")
        <em>; Set the menu item's icon.</em>
        Fmenu.SetIcon A_Index "&amp;", "HICON:" hicon
        <em>; Because we used ":" and not ":*", the icon will be automatically
        ; freed when the program exits or if the menu or item is deleted.</em>
    }
}
until A_Index = n
Fmenu.Show
</pre>

<h1>Labels</h1>

  <li><a href="#named-loops">Named Loops</a></li>
  <li><a href="#related">Related</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="syntax-and-usage">Syntax and Usage</h2>
<p>A label identifies a line of code, and can be used as a <a href="../lib/Goto.htm">Goto</a> target or to <a href="#named-loops">specify a loop</a> to break out of or continue. A label consist of a <a href="../Concepts.htm#names">name</a> followed by a colon:</p>
<pre>this_is_a_label:
</pre>
<p>Aside from whitespace and comments, no other code can be written on the same line as a label.</p>
<p><strong>Names:</strong> Label names are not case sensitive (for ASCII letters), and may consist of letters, numbers, underscore and non-ASCII characters. For example: <em>MyListView</em>, <em>Menu_File_Open</em>, and <em>outer_loop</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong> Each function has its own list of local labels. Inside a function, only that function's labels are visible/accessible to the script.</p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> The target of a label is the next line of executable code. Executable code includes functions, assignments, <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expressions</a> and <a href="../lib/Block.htm">blocks</a>, but not directives, labels, hotkeys or hotstrings. In the following example, <code>run_notepad_1</code> and <code>run_notepad_2</code> both point at the <code>Run</code> line:</p>
<pre>run_notepad_1:
run_notepad_2:
    Run "notepad"
    return
</pre>
<p><strong>Execution:</strong> Like directives, labels have no effect when reached during normal execution.</p>

<h2 id="look-alikes">Look-alikes</h2>
<p>Hotkey and hotstring definitions look similar to labels, but are not labels.</p>
<p><a href="../Hotkeys.htm">Hotkeys</a> consist of a hotkey followed by double-colon.</p>
<pre>^a::</pre>
<p><a href="../Hotstrings.htm">Hotstrings</a> consist of a colon, zero or more <a href="../Hotstrings.htm#Options">options</a>, another colon, an abbreviation and double-colon.</p>
<pre>:*:btw::</pre>

<h2 id="dynamic-labels">Dynamic Labels</h2>
<p>In some cases a <a href="../Variables.htm">variable</a> can be used in place of a label name. In such cases, the name stored in the variable is used to locate the target label. However, performance is slightly reduced because the target label must be "looked up" each time rather than only once when the script is first loaded.</p>

<h2 id="named-loops">Named Loops</h2>
<p>A label can also be used to identify a loop for the <a href="../lib/Continue.htm">Continue</a> and <a href="../lib/Break.htm">Break</a> statements. This allows the script to easily continue or break out of any number of nested loops.</p>

<p>You can compare <em>A_Language</em> directly to one or more of the 4-digit codes below; for example: <code>if (A_Language = "0436")</code>. Alternatively, you can paste the entire list into a script and then access the name of the current language as demonstrated at the bottom of the list.</p>

<body>
<h1>Long Paths</h1>

<p>In general, programs are affected by two kinds of path length limitations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Functions provided by the operating system generally limit paths to 259 characters, with some exceptions.</li>
  <li>Code for dealing with paths within the program may rely on the first limitation to simplify the code, effectively placing another 259 character limitation.</li>
</ol>
<p>These limitations are often referred to as "MAX_PATH limitations", after the constant <code>MAX_PATH</code>, which has the value 260. One character is generally reserved for a null terminator, leaving 259 characters for the actual path.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey removes the second kind in most cases, which enables the script to work around the first kind. There are two ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Long paths can be enabled for AutoHotkey and all other long-path-aware programs on Windows 10. Refer to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later">Microsoft documentation</a> for details. In short, this enables most functions to transparently work with long paths, but requires Windows 10 version 1607 or later.</li>
  <li>In many cases, prefixing the path with <code>\\?\</code> enables it to exceed the usual limit. However, some system functions do not support it (or long paths in general). See <a href="#limitations">Known Limitations</a> for details.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prefix">Long Path Prefix</h2>
<p>If supported by the underlying system function, the <code>\\?\</code> prefix -- for example, in <code>\\?\C:\My Folder</code> -- increases the limit to 32,767 characters. However, it does this by skipping <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/jeremykuhne/path-normalization">path normalization</a>. Some elements of the path which would normally be removed or altered by normalization instead become part of the file's actual path. Care must be taken as this can allow the creation of paths that "normal" programs cannot access.</p>
<p>In particular, normalization:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resolves relative paths such as <code>dir\file.ext</code>, <code>\file.ext</code> and <code>C:file.ext</code> (note the absence of a slash).</li>
  <li>Resolves relative components such as <code>\..</code> and <code>\.</code>.</li>
  <li>Canonicalizes component/directory separators, replacing <code>/</code> with <code>\</code> and eliminating redundant separators.</li>
  <li>Trims certain characters, such as a single period at the end of a component (<code>dir.\file</code>) or trailing spaces and periods (<code>dir\filename . .</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>A path can be normalized explicitly by passing it to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfullpathnamew">GetFullPathName</a> via the function defined below, before applying the prefix. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox "\\?\" NormalizePath("..\file.ext")</pre>
<pre filename="foo.ahk">NormalizePath(path) {
    cc := DllCall("GetFullPathName", "str", path, "uint", 0, "ptr", 0, "ptr", 0, "uint")
    buf := Buffer(cc*2)
    DllCall("GetFullPathName", "str", path, "uint", cc, "ptr", buf, "ptr", 0)
    return StrGet(buf)
}</pre>
<p>A path with the <code>\\?\</code> prefix can also be normalized by this function. However, in that case the working directory is never used, and the root is <code>\\?\</code> (for example, <code>\\?\C:\..</code> resolves to <code>\\?\</code> whereas <code>C:\..</code> resolves to <code>C:\</code>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Known Limitations</h2>
<p>Even when the path itself is not limited to 259 characters, each component (file or directory name) cannot exceed the hard limit imposed by the file system (usually 255 characters).</p>
<p>These do not support long paths due to limitations of the underlying system function(s):</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> (for <em>DllFile</em> and <em>Function</em>)</li>
  <li><a href="../lib/DirCopy.htm">DirCopy</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/DirDelete.htm">DirDelete</a>, unless <em>Recurse</em> is false</li>
  <li><a href="../lib/DirMove.htm">DirMove</a>, unless the R option is used</li>
  <li><a href="../lib/FileCreateShortcut.htm">FileCreateShortcut</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/FileGetShortcut.htm">FileGetShortcut</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/FileRecycle.htm">FileRecycle</a></li>
  <li><a href="../lib/SoundPlay.htm">SoundPlay</a> (for this, the limit is 127 characters)</li>
  <li><a href="../lib/DriveSetLabel.htm">DriveSetLabel</a> and <a href="../lib/Drive.htm">DriveGet variants</a> (except <a href="../lib/DriveGetType.htm">DriveGetType</a>)</li>
  <li>Built-in variables which return special folder paths (for which long paths might be impossible anyway): <a href="../Variables.htm#AppData">A_AppData</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Desktop">A_Desktop</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#MyDocuments">A_MyDocuments</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#ProgramFiles">A_ProgramFiles</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Programs">A_Programs</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#StartMenu">A_StartMenu</a>, <a href="../Variables.htm#Startup">A_Startup</a> and Common variants, <a href="../Variables.htm#Temp">A_Temp</a> and <a href="../Variables.htm#WinDir">A_WinDir</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../lib/SetWorkingDir.htm">SetWorkingDir</a> and <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> support long paths only when Windows 10 long path awareness is enabled, since the <code>\\?\</code> prefix cannot be used. If the working directory exceeds MAX_PATH, it becomes impossible to launch programs with <a href="../lib/Run.htm">Run</a>. These limitations are imposed by the OS.</p>
<p>It does not appear to be possible to run an executable with a full path which exceeds MAX_PATH. That being the case, it would not be possible to fully test any changes aimed at supporting longer executable paths. Therefore, MAX_PATH limits have been left in place for the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="WinTitle.htm#ahk_exe">ahk_exe</a></li>
  <li>The default script's path, which is based on the current executable's path.</li>
  <li>Retrieval of the AutoHotkey installation directory, which is used by <a href="../Variables.htm#AhkPath">A_AhkPath</a> in compiled scripts and may be used to launch Window Spy or the help file.</li>
  <li><a href="../lib/WinGetProcessPath.htm">WinGetProcessPath</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="../lib/WinGetProcessName.htm">WinGetProcessName</a> (this theoretically isn't a problem since it is applied only to the name portion, and NTFS only supports names up to 255 chars).</li>
</ul>
<p>Long <a href="../lib/_Include.htm">#Include</a> paths shown in error messages may be truncated arbitrarily.</p>

<h1>Creating a Keyboard Macro or Mouse Macro</h1>

<p>A macro is a series of scripted actions that is "played" upon demand. The most common activity of a macro is to send <a href="../lib/Send.htm">simulated keystrokes</a> and <a href="../lib/Click.htm">mouse clicks</a> to one or more windows. Such windows respond to each keystroke and mouse click as though you had performed it manually, which allows repetitive tasks to be automated with high speed and reliability.</p>
<p>One of the most convenient ways to play back a macro is to assign it to a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> or <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstring</a>.  For example, the following hotkey would create an empty e-mail message and prepare it for a certain type recipient, allowing you to personalize it prior to sending:</p>
<pre>^!s::  <em>; Control+Alt+S hotkey.</em>
{
    if not WinExist("Inbox - Microsoft Outlook")
        return  <em>; Outlook isn't open to the right section, so do nothing.</em>
    WinActivate  <em>; Activate the window found by the above function.</em>
    Send "^n"  <em>; Create new/blank e-mail via Control+N.</em>
    WinWaitActive "Untitled Message"
    Send "{Tab 2}Product Recall for ACME Rocket Skates"  <em>; Set the subject line.</em>
    Send "{Tab}Dear Sir or Madam,{Enter 2}We have recently discovered a minor defect ..."  <em>; etc.</em>
} <em>; This brace marks the end of the hotkey.</em></pre>
<p>Hotkey macros like the above are especially useful for tasks you perform several times per day. By contrast, macros used less often can each be kept in a separate script accessible by means of a shortcut in the Start Menu or on the desktop.</p>
<p>To start creating your own macros and hotkeys right away, please read the <a href="../Tutorial.htm">Quick-start Tutorial</a>.</p>

<title>Overriding or Disabling Hotkeys | AutoHotkey v2</title>

<body>
<h1>Overriding or Disabling Hotkeys</h1>

<p>You can disable all built-in Windows hotkeys except <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> and <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd> by making the following change to the registry (this should work on all OSes but a reboot is probably required):</p>
<pre>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer
NoWinKeys REG_DWORD 0x00000001 (1)</pre>
<p>But read on if you want to do more than just disable them all.</p>
<p>Hotkeys owned by another application can be overridden or disabled simply by assigning them to an action in the script. The most common use for this feature is to change the hotkeys that are built into Windows itself. For example, if you wish <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> (the shortcut key that launches Windows Explorer) to perform some other action, use this:</p>
<pre>#e::MsgBox "This hotkey is now owned by the script."</pre>
<p>In the next example, the <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> hotkey, which is used to open the RUN window, is completely disabled:</p>
<pre>#r::return</pre>
<p>Similarly, to disable both <kbd>Win</kbd>, use this:</p>
<pre>LWin::return
RWin::return</pre>
<p>To disable or change an application's non-global hotkey (that is, a shortcut key that only works when that application is the active window), consider the following example which disables <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Print) only for Notepad, leaving the key in effect for all other types of windows:</p>
<pre>$^p::
{
	if WinActive("ahk_class Notepad")
		return  <em>; i.e. do nothing, which causes Control-P to do nothing in Notepad.</em>
	Send "^p"
}</pre>
<p>In the above example, the $ prefix is needed so that the hotkey can "send itself" without activating itself (which would otherwise trigger a warning dialog about an infinite loop). See also: <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#Context">context-sensitive hotkeys</a>.</p>
<p>You can try out any of the above examples by copying them into a new text file such as "Override.ahk", then launching the file.</p>

<h1>Script Performance</h1>

<p>The following functions may affect performance depending on the nature of the script: <a href="../lib/SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>, <a href="../lib/SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a>, <a href="../lib/SetMouseDelay.htm">SetMouseDelay</a>, <a href="../lib/SetWinDelay.htm">SetWinDelay</a>, <a href="../lib/SetControlDelay.htm">SetControlDelay</a>, and <a href="../lib/SetDefaultMouseSpeed.htm">SetDefaultMouseSpeed</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Built-in_Performance_Features">Built-in Performance Features</h2>
<p>Each script is semi-compiled while it is being loaded and syntax-checked. In addition to detecting some errors early, this also greatly improves runtime performance.</p>
<p>Here are some of the technical details of the optimization process (semi-compiling):</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../lib/Loop.htm">Loops</a>, <a href="../lib/Block.htm">blocks</a>, <a href="../lib/If.htm">IFs</a>, <a href="../lib/Else.htm">ELSEs</a> and other <a href="../Language.htm#control-flow">control flow statements</a> are given the memory addresses of their related jump-points in the script.</li>
  <li>Each statement name is replaced by an address in a jump table.</li>
  <li>Each <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a> is tokenized and converted from infix to postfix.</li>
  <li>Each reference to a <a href="../Variables.htm">variable</a> or <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a> is resolved to a memory address, unless it is <a href="../Variables.htm#deref">dynamic</a>.</li>
  <li>Literal integers in expressions are replaced with binary integers.</li>
  <li>The destination of each <a href="../lib/Goto.htm">Goto</a> is resolved to a memory address unless it is a variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, during script execution, binary numbers are cached in variables to avoid conversions to/from strings.</p>

  <li><a href="#fundamentals">Fundamentals</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Options">Options (case sensitive)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Common">Commonly Used Symbols and Syntax</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
<p><strong>Match anywhere</strong>: By default, a regular expression matches a substring <em>anywhere</em> inside the string to be searched. For example, the regular expression <span class="regex">abc</span> matches <span class="subj">abc</span>123, 123<span class="subj">abc</span>, and 123<span class="subj">abc</span>xyz. To require the match to occur only at the beginning or end, use an <a href="#anchor">anchor</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Escaped characters</strong>: Most characters like abc123 can be used literally inside a regular expression. However, the characters <strong>\.*?+[{|()^$</strong> must be preceded by a backslash to be seen as literal. For example, <span class="regex">\.</span> is a literal period and <span class="regex">\\</span> is a literal backslash. Escaping can be avoided by using \Q...\E. For example: <span class="regex">\QLiteral Text\E</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Case-sensitive</strong>: By default, regular expressions are case-sensitive. This can be changed via the "i" option. For example, the pattern <span class="regex">i)abc</span> searches for "abc" without regard to case. See below for other modifiers.</p>

<h2 id="Options">Options (case sensitive)</h2>
<p>At the very beginning of a regular expression, specify zero or more of the following options followed by a close-parenthesis. For example, the pattern <span class="regex"><span class="red">im)</span>abc</span> would search for "abc" with the case-insensitive and multiline options (the parenthesis may be omitted when there are no options). Although this syntax breaks from tradition, it requires no special delimiters (such as forward-slash), and thus there is no need to escape such delimiters inside the pattern. In addition, performance is improved because the options are easier to parse.</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr>
    <th class="center">Option</th>
    <th abbr="Descr">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr id="opt_i">
    <td class="center bold">i</td>
    <td>Case-insensitive matching, which treats the letters A through Z as identical to their lowercase counterparts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="Multiline">
    <td class="center bold">m</td>
    <td><p>Multiline. Views <em>Haystack</em> as a collection of individual lines (if it contains newlines) rather than as a single continuous line. Specifically, it changes the following:</p>
      <p>1) Circumflex (^) matches immediately after all internal newlines -- as well as at the start of <em>Haystack</em> where it always matches (but it does not match after a newline <em>at the very end</em> of <em>Haystack</em>).</p>
      <p>2) Dollar-sign ($) matches before any newlines in <em>Haystack</em> (as well as at the very end where it always matches).</p>
      <p>For example, the pattern <span class="regex"><span class="red">m)</span>^abc$</span> matches xyz`r`n<span class="subj">abc</span>. But without the "m" option, it wouldn't match.</p>
      <p>The "D" option is ignored when "m" is present.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="opt_s">
    <td class="center bold">s</td>
    <td>DotAll. This causes a period (.) to match all characters including newlines (normally, it does not match newlines). However, two dots are required to match a CRLF newline sequence (`r`n), not one. Regardless of this option, a negative class such as <span class="regex">[^a]</span> always matches newlines.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="opt_x">
    <td class="center bold">x</td>
    <td>Ignores whitespace characters in the pattern except when escaped or inside a character class. The characters `n and `t are among those ignored because by the time they get to PCRE, they are already raw/literal whitespace characters (by contrast, \n and \t are not ignored because they are PCRE escape sequences). The "x" option also ignores characters between a non-escaped # outside a character class and the next newline character, inclusive. This makes it possible to include comments inside complicated patterns. However, this applies only to data characters; whitespace may never appear within special character sequences such as (?(, which begins a conditional subpattern.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="opt_A">
    <td class="center bold">A</td>
    <td>Forces the pattern to be anchored; that is, it can match only at the start of <em>Haystack</em>. Under most conditions, this is equivalent to explicitly anchoring the pattern by means such as "^".</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="opt_D">
    <td class="center bold">D</td>
    <td>Forces dollar-sign ($) to match at the very end of <em>Haystack</em>, even if <em>Haystack</em>'s last item is a newline. Without this option, $ instead matches right before the final newline (if there is one). Note: This option is ignored when the "m" option is present.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="opt_J">
    <td class="center bold">J</td>
    <td>Allows duplicate <a href="../lib/RegExMatch.htm#NamedSubPat">named subpatterns</a>. This can be useful for patterns in which only one of a collection of identically-named subpatterns can match. Note: If more than one instance of a particular name matches something, only the leftmost one is stored. Also, variable names are not case-sensitive.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="opt_U">
    <td class="center bold">U</td>
    <td>Ungreedy. Makes the quantifiers <strong>*</strong>, <strong>?</strong>, <strong>+</strong> and <strong>{min,max}</strong> consume only those characters absolutely necessary to form a match, leaving the remaining ones available for the next part of the pattern. When the "U" option is not in effect, an individual quantifier can be made non-greedy by following it with a question mark. Conversely, when "U" <em>is</em> in effect, the question mark makes an individual quantifier greedy.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="opt_extra">
    <td class="center bold">X</td>
    <td>PCRE_EXTRA. Enables PCRE features that are incompatible with Perl. Currently, the only such feature is that any backslash in a pattern that is followed by a letter that has no special meaning causes an exception to be thrown. This option helps reserve unused backslash sequences for future use. Without this option, a backslash followed by a letter with no special meaning is treated as a literal (e.g. \g and g are both recognized as a literal g). Regardless of this option, non-alphabetic backslash sequences that have no special meaning are always treated as literals (e.g. \/ and / are both recognized as forward-slash).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="Study">
    <td class="center bold">S</td>
    <td>Studies the pattern to try improve its performance. This is useful when a particular pattern (especially a complex one) will be executed many times. If PCRE finds a way to improve performance, that discovery is stored alongside the pattern in the cache for use by subsequent executions of the same pattern (subsequent uses of that pattern should also specify the S option because finding a match in the cache requires that the option letters exactly match, including their order).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="opt_Callout">
    <td class="center bold">C</td>
    <td>Enables the auto-callout mode. See <a href="RegExCallout.htm#auto">Regular Expression Callouts</a> for more info.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="NEWLINE_ANY">

For example, the pattern <span class="regex">&lt;.+&gt;</span> (which lacks a question mark) means: "search for a &lt;, followed by one or more of any character, followed by a &gt;". To stop this pattern from matching the <em>entire</em> string <span class="subj"><span class="red"><strong>&lt;</strong></span>em&gt;text&lt;/em<span class="red"><strong>&gt;</strong></span></span>, append a question mark to the plus sign: <span class="regex">&lt;.+<span class="red">?</span>&gt;</span>.

<p><strong>Look-ahead and look-behind assertions</strong>: The groups <span class="regex">(?=...)</span>, <span class="regex">(?!...)</span>, <span class="regex">(?&lt;=...)</span>, and <span class="regex">(?&lt;!...)</span> are called <em>assertions</em> because they demand a condition to be met but don't consume any characters. For example, <span class="regex">abc(?=.*xyz)</span> is a look-ahead assertion that requires the string xyz to exist somewhere to the right of the string abc (if it doesn't, the entire pattern is not considered a match). <span class="regex">(?=...)</span> is called a <em>positive</em> look-ahead because it requires that the specified pattern exist. Conversely, <span class="regex">(?!...)</span> is a <em>negative</em> look-ahead because it requires that the specified pattern <em>not</em> exist. Similarly, <span class="regex">(?&lt;=...)</span> and <span class="regex">(?&lt;!...)</span> are positive and negative look-<em>behinds</em> (respectively) because they look to the <em>left</em> of the current position rather than the right. Look-behinds are more limited than look-aheads because they do not support quantifiers of varying size such as <strong>*</strong>, <strong>?</strong>, and <strong>+</strong>. The escape sequence <strong>\K</strong> is similar to a look-behind assertion because it causes any previously-matched characters to be omitted from the final matched string. For example, <span class="regex">foo\Kbar</span> matches "foobar" but reports that it has matched "bar".</p>

<h1>Regular Expression Callouts</h1>

<p>RegEx callouts provide a means of temporarily passing control to the script in the middle of regular expression pattern matching. For detailed information about the PCRE-standard callout feature, see <a href="http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt">pcre.txt</a>.</p>

<p>RegEx callouts are currently supported only by <a href="../lib/RegExMatch.htm">RegExMatch</a> and <a href="../lib/RegExReplace.htm">RegExReplace</a>.</p>

    <li><a href="#auto">Auto-Callout</a></li>
    <li><a href="#remarks">Remarks</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

<p>The syntax for a RegEx callout in AutoHotkey is <span class="regex">(?C<em>Number</em>:<em>Function</em>)</span>, where both <em>Number</em> and <em>Function</em> are optional. Colon ':' is allowed only if <em>Function</em> is specified, and is optional if <em>Number</em> is omitted. If <em>Function</em> is specified but is not the name of a <a href="Functor.htm">function object</a>, a compile error occurs and pattern-matching does not begin.</p>

<p>If <em>Function</em> is omitted, the default RegEx callout function named <b>pcre_callout</b> must be defined. If <em>pcre_callout</em> is not defined, RegEx callouts which omit <em>Function</em> are ignored.</p>

<h2 id="callout-functions">RegEx Callout Functions</h2>

<pre class="Syntax"><i>MyFunction</i>(Match, CalloutNumber, FoundPos, Haystack, NeedleRegEx)
{
    ...
}</pre>
<p>RegEx callout functions may define up to 5 parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Match</b>: Receives a <a href="../lib/RegExMatch.htm#MatchObject">RegExMatchInfo</a> object containing information about the match so far.</li>
  <li><b>CalloutNumber</b>: Receives the <em>Number</em> of the RegEx callout.</li>
  <li><b>FoundPos</b>: Receives the position of the current potential match.</li>
  <li><b>Haystack</b>: Receives the <em>Haystack</em> passed to RegExMatch or RegExReplace.</li>
  <li><b>NeedleRegEx</b>: Receives the <em>NeedleRegEx</em> passed to RegExMatch or RegExReplace.</li>
</ul>
<p>These names are suggestive only. Actual names may vary.</p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Changing the input parameters of <a href="../lib/RegExReplace.htm">RegExReplace</a> or <a href="../lib/RegExMatch.htm">RegExMatch</a> during a call is unsupported and may cause unpredictable behaviour.</p>

<p>Pattern-matching may proceed or fail depending on the return value of the RegEx callout function:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the function returns <b>0</b> or does not return a numeric value, matching proceeds as normal.</li>
  <li>If the function returns <b>1</b> or greater, matching fails at the current point, but the testing of other matching possibilities goes ahead.</li>
  <li>If the function returns <b>-1</b>, matching is abandoned.</li>
  <li>If the function returns a value less than -1, it is treated as a PCRE error code and matching is abandoned. This causes RegExMatch and RegExReplace to throw an exception; the <em>Extra</em> property of the exception object contains the error code.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>Haystack := "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
RegExMatch(Haystack, "i)(The) (\w+)\b(?CCallout)")
Callout(m, *) {
    MsgBox "m[0]=" m[0] "`nm[1]=" m[1] "`nm[2]=" m[2]
    return 1
}</pre>
<p>In the above example, <em>Callout</em> is called once for each substring which matches the part of the pattern preceding the RegEx callout. <span class="regex">\b</span> is used to exclude incomplete words in matches such as <em>The quic</em>, <em>The qui</em>, <em>The qu</em>, etc.</p>
<p>If any of the input parameters to a <em>RegEx</em> function is modified during a callout, the behaviour is undefined.</p>
    
<h2 id="EventInfo">EventInfo</h2>

<p>Additional information is available by accessing the pcre_callout_block structure via <b>A_EventInfo</b>.</p>
<pre>version           := NumGet(A_EventInfo,  0, "Int")
callout_number    := NumGet(A_EventInfo,  4, "Int")
offset_vector     := NumGet(A_EventInfo,  8, "Ptr")

start_match       := NumGet(A_EventInfo, 12 + A_PtrSize*2, "Int")
current_position  := NumGet(A_EventInfo, 16 + A_PtrSize*2, "Int")
capture_top       := NumGet(A_EventInfo, 20 + A_PtrSize*2, "Int")
capture_last      := NumGet(A_EventInfo, 24 + A_PtrSize*2, "Int")
pad := A_PtrSize=8 ? 4 : 0  <em>; Compensate for 64-bit data alignment.</em>
callout_data      := NumGet(A_EventInfo, 28 + pad + A_PtrSize*2, "Ptr")
pattern_position  := NumGet(A_EventInfo, 28 + pad + A_PtrSize*3, "Int")
next_item_length  := NumGet(A_EventInfo, 32 + pad + A_PtrSize*3, "Int")
if (version &gt;= 2)
    mark   := StrGet(NumGet(A_EventInfo, 36 + pad + A_PtrSize*3, "Int"), "UTF-8")
</pre>
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt">pcre.txt</a>, <a href="../lib/NumGet.htm">NumGet</a> and <a href="../Variables.htm#PtrSize">A_PtrSize</a>.</p>

<h2 id="auto">Auto-Callout</h2>

<p>Including <strong>C</strong> in the options of the pattern enables the auto-callout mode. In this mode, RegEx callouts equivalent to <span class="regex">(?C255)</span> are inserted before each item in the pattern. For example, the following template may be used to debug regular expressions:</p>
<pre><em>; Call RegExMatch with auto-callout option C.</em>
RegExMatch("xxxabc123xyz", "C)abc.*xyz")

<em>; Define the default RegEx callout function.</em>
pcre_callout(Match, CalloutNumber, FoundPos, Haystack, NeedleRegEx)
{
    <em>; See pcre.txt for descriptions of these fields.</em>
    start_match       := NumGet(A_EventInfo, 12 + A_PtrSize*2, "Int")
    current_position  := NumGet(A_EventInfo, 16 + A_PtrSize*2, "Int")
    pad := A_PtrSize=8 ? 4 : 0
    pattern_position  := NumGet(A_EventInfo, 28 + pad + A_PtrSize*3, "Int")
    next_item_length  := NumGet(A_EventInfo, 32 + pad + A_PtrSize*3, "Int")

    <em>; Point out &gt;&gt;current match&lt;&lt;.</em>
    _HAYSTACK:=SubStr(Haystack, 1, start_match)
        . "&gt;&gt;" SubStr(Haystack, start_match + 1, current_position - start_match)
        . "&lt;&lt;" SubStr(Haystack, current_position + 1)
    
    <em>; Point out &gt;&gt;next item to be evaluated&lt;&lt;.</em>
    _NEEDLE:=  SubStr(NeedleRegEx, 1, pattern_position)
        . "&gt;&gt;" SubStr(NeedleRegEx, pattern_position + 1, next_item_length)
        . "&lt;&lt;" SubStr(NeedleRegEx, pattern_position + 1 + next_item_length)
    
    ListVars
    <em>; Press Pause to continue.</em>
    Pause
}</pre>

<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>

<p>RegEx callouts are executed on the current quasi-thread, but the previous value of A_EventInfo will be restored after the RegEx callout function returns.</p>
<p>PCRE is optimized to abort early in some cases if it can determine that a match is not possible. For all RegEx callouts to be called in such cases, it may be necessary to disable these optimizations by specifying <span class="regex">(*NO_START_OPT)</span> at the start of the pattern.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Limitation</strong>: AutoHotkey's remapping feature described below is generally not as pure and effective as remapping directly via the Windows registry. For the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, see <a href="#registry">registry remapping</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Remap">Remapping the Keyboard and Mouse</h2>
<p>The syntax for the built-in remapping feature is <code>OriginKey::DestinationKey</code>. For example, a <a href="../Scripts.htm">script</a> consisting only of the following line would make <kbd>A</kbd> behave like <kbd>B</kbd>:</p>
<pre>a::b</pre>
<p>The above example does not alter <kbd>B</kbd> itself. <kbd>B</kbd> would continue to send the "b" keystroke unless you remap it to something else as shown in the following example:</p>
<pre>a::b
b::a</pre>
<p>The examples above use lowercase, which is recommended for most purposes because it also remaps the corresponding uppercase letters (that is, it will send uppercase when <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> is "on" or <kbd>Shift</kbd> is held down). By contrast, specifying an uppercase letter on the right side forces uppercase. For example, the following line would produce an uppercase B when you type either "a" or "A" (as long as <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> is off):</p>
<pre>a::B</pre>
<p>Conversely, any modifiers included on the left side but not the right side are automatically released when the key is sent. For example, the following two lines would produce a lowercase "b" when you press either Shift+A or Ctrl+A:</p>
<pre>A::b
^a::b</pre>

<h3 id="RemapMouse">Mouse Remapping</h3>
<p>To remap the mouse instead of the keyboard, use the same approach. For example:</p>

    <td>Makes <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> become <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. To retain the ability to turn <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> on and off, add the remapping <code>+CapsLock::CapsLock</code> first. This toggles <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> on and off when you hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> and press <kbd>CapsLock</kbd>. Because both remappings allow additional modifier keys to be held down, the more specific <code>+CapsLock::CapsLock</code> remapping must be placed first for it to work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>XButton2::^LButton</code></td>
    <td>Makes the fifth mouse button (XButton2) produce a control-click.</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>RCtrl::RWin</code></td>
    <td>Makes the right <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> become the right <kbd>Win</kbd>.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>RWin::Return</code></td>
    <td>Disables the right <kbd>Win</kbd> by having it simply <a href="../lib/Return.htm">return</a>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>You can try out any of these examples by copying them into a new text file such as "Remap.ahk", then launching the file.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../KeyList.htm">Key List</a> for a complete list of key and mouse button names.</p>
<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The <a href="../lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> directive can be used to make selected remappings active only in the windows you specify (or while any given condition is met). For example:</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActive("ahk_class Notepad")
a::b  <em>; Makes the 'a' key send a 'b' key, but only in Notepad.</em>
#HotIf  <em>; This puts subsequent remappings and hotkeys in effect for all windows.</em></pre>
<p>Remapping a key or button is "complete" in the following respects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Holding down a modifier such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> while typing the origin key will put that modifier into effect for the destination key. For example, <code>b::a</code> would produce <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> if you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>.</li>
  <li><kbd>CapsLock</kbd> generally affects remapped keys in the same way as normal keys.</li>
  <li>The destination key or button is held down for as long as you continue to hold down the origin key. However, some games do not support remapping; in such cases, the keyboard and mouse will behave as though not remapped.</li>
  <li>Remapped keys will auto-repeat while being held down (except keys remapped to become mouse buttons).</li>
</ul>
<p id="HookHotkeys">Although a remapped key can trigger normal hotkeys, by default it cannot trigger mouse hotkeys or <a href="../lib/_UseHook.htm">hook hotkeys</a> (use <a href="../lib/ListHotkeys.htm">ListHotkeys</a> to discover which hotkeys are "hook"). For example, if the remapping <code>a::b</code> is in effect, pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> would trigger the <code>^!b</code> hotkey only if <code>^!b</code> is not a hook hotkey. If <code>^!b</code> is a hook hotkey, you can define <code>^!a</code> as a hotkey if you want <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to perform the same action as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>. For example:</p>
<pre>a::b
^!a::
^!b::ToolTip "You pressed " ThisHotkey
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="../lib/_InputLevel.htm">#InputLevel</a> can be used to override the default behaviour. For example:</p>
<pre>#InputLevel 1
a::b

#InputLevel 0
^!b::ToolTip "You pressed " ThisHotkey
</pre>
<p id="SendPlay">If <a href="../lib/SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> is used during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a>, it affects all remappings. However, since remapping uses <a href="../lib/Send.htm#blind">Send "{Blind}"</a> and since the <a href="../lib/SendMode.htm">SendPlay mode</a> does not fully support  {Blind}, some remappings might not function properly in SendPlay mode (especially <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, and <kbd>Win</kbd>). To work around this, avoid using <code>SendMode "Play"</code> during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a> when you have remappings; then use the function <a href="../lib/Send.htm#SendPlay">SendPlay</a> vs. Send in other places throughout the script. Alternatively, you could translate your remappings into hotkeys (as described below) that explicitly call SendEvent vs. Send.</p>
<p id="EscapeBrace">If <em>DestinationKey</em> is meant to be <code>{</code>, it has to be <a href="EscapeChar.htm">escaped</a>, for example, <code>x::`{</code>. Otherwise it is interpreted as the opening brace for the <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>'s function.</p>
<p id="actually">When a script is launched, each remapping is translated into a pair of <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a>. For example, a script containing <code>a::b</code> actually contains the following two hotkeys instead:</p>
<pre>*<strong>a</strong>::
{
    SetKeyDelay -1   <em>; If the destination key is a mouse button, SetMouseDelay is used instead.</em>
    Send "<a href="../lib/Send.htm#blind">{Blind}</a>{<strong>b</strong> DownR}"  <em>; <a href="../lib/Send.htm#DownR">DownR</a> is like Down except that other Send functions in the script won't assume "b" should stay down during their Send.</em>
}

*<strong>a up</strong>::
{
    SetKeyDelay -1  <em>; See note below for why press-duration is not specified with either of these SetKeyDelays.</em>
    Send "{Blind}{<strong>b</strong> Up}"
}</pre>
<p>However, the above hotkeys vary under the following circumstances:</p>
<ol>
  <li>When the source key is the left <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and the destination key is <kbd>Alt</kbd>, the line <code>Send "{Blind}{LAlt DownR}"</code> is replaced by <code>Send "{Blind}<strong>{LCtrl up}</strong>{LAlt DownR}"</code>. The same is true if the source is the right <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, except that <code>{RCtrl up}</code> is used.</li>
  <li>When a keyboard key is being remapped to become a mouse button (e.g. <code>RCtrl::RButton</code>), the hotkeys above use SetMouseDelay in place of SetKeyDelay. In addition, the first hotkey above is replaced by the following, which prevents the keyboard's auto-repeat feature from generating repeated mouse clicks:
    <pre>*RCtrl::
{
    SetMouseDelay -1
    if not GetKeyState("RButton")  <em>; i.e. the right mouse button isn't down yet.</em>
        Send "{Blind}{RButton DownR}"
}</pre>
  </li>
  <li>When the source is a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#combo">custom combination</a>, the wildcard modifier (*) is omitted to allow the hotkeys to work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that SetKeyDelay's second parameter (<a href="../lib/SetKeyDelay.htm#dur">press duration</a>) is omitted in the hotkeys above. This is because press-duration does not apply to down-only or up-only events such as <code>{b down}</code> and <code>{b up}</code>. However, it does apply to changes in the state of the modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and Win), which affects remappings such as <code>a::B</code> or <code>a::^b</code>. Consequently, any press-duration a script puts into effect during <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">script startup</a> will apply to all such remappings.</p>
<p>Since remappings are translated into hotkeys as described above, the <a href="../lib/Suspend.htm">Suspend</a> function affects them. Similarly, the <a href="../lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> function can disable or modify a remapping. For example, the following two functions would disable the remapping <code>a::b</code>.</p>
<pre>Hotkey "*a", "Off"
Hotkey "*a up", "Off"</pre>
<p id="AltTab">Alt-tab issues: If you remap a key or mouse button to become <kbd>Alt</kbd>, that key will probably not be able to alt-tab properly. A possible work-around is to add the hotkey <code>*Tab::Send "{Blind}{Tab}"</code> -- but be aware that it will likely interfere with using the real <kbd>Alt</kbd> to alt-tab. Therefore, it should be used only when you alt-tab solely by means of remapped keys and/or <a href="../Hotkeys.htm#alttab">alt-tab hotkeys</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the keys and mouse buttons on the <a href="../KeyList.htm">Key List</a> page, the source key may also be a virtual key (VKnn) or scan code (SCnnn) as described on the <a href="../KeyList.htm#SpecialKeys">special keys</a> page. The same is true for the destination key except that it may optionally specify a scan code after the virtual key. For example, <code>sc01e::vk42sc030</code> is equivalent to <code>a::b</code> on most keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>To disable a key rather than remapping it, make it a hotkey that simply <a href="../lib/Return.htm">returns</a>. For example, <code>F1::return</code> would disable <kbd>F1</kbd>.</p>
<p>The following keys are not supported by the built-in remapping method:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The mouse wheel (WheelUp/Down/Left/Right).</li>
  <li>"Pause" as a destination key name (since it matches the name of a built-in function). Instead use <code>vk13</code> or the corresponding scan code.</li>
  <li>Curly braces {} as destination keys. Instead use the <a href="../lib/Send.htm#vk">VK/SC method</a>; e.g. <code>x::+sc01A</code> and <code>y::+sc01B</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="moving-the-mouse-cursor">Moving the Mouse Cursor via the Keyboard</h2>
<p>The keyboard can be used to move the mouse cursor as demonstrated by the fully-featured <a href="../scripts/index.htm#NumpadMouse">Keyboard-To-Mouse script</a>. Since that script offers smooth cursor movement, acceleration, and other features, it is the recommended approach if you plan to do a lot of mousing with the keyboard. By contrast, the following example is a simpler demonstration:</p>
<pre>*#up::MouseMove 0, -10, 0, "R"  <em>; Win+UpArrow hotkey =&gt; Move cursor upward</em>
*#Down::MouseMove 0, 10, 0, "R"  <em>; Win+DownArrow =&gt; Move cursor downward</em>
*#Left::MouseMove -10, 0, 0, "R"  <em>; Win+LeftArrow =&gt; Move cursor to the left</em>
*#Right::MouseMove 10, 0, 0, "R"  <em>; Win+RightArrow =&gt; Move cursor to the right</em>

*&lt;#RCtrl::  <em>; LeftWin + RightControl =&gt; Left-click (hold down Control/Shift to Control-Click or Shift-Click).</em>
{
    SendEvent "{Blind}{LButton down}"
    KeyWait "RCtrl"  <em>; Prevents keyboard auto-repeat from repeating the mouse click.</em>
    SendEvent "{Blind}{LButton up}"
}

*&lt;#AppsKey::  <em>; LeftWin + AppsKey =&gt; Right-click</em>
{
    SendEvent "{Blind}{RButton down}"
    KeyWait "AppsKey"  <em>; Prevents keyboard auto-repeat from repeating the mouse click.</em>
    SendEvent "{Blind}{RButton up}"
}</pre>
<h2 id="registry">Remapping via the Registry's "Scancode Map"</h2>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Registry remapping is generally more pure and effective than <a href="#Remap">AutoHotkey's remapping</a>. For example, it works in a broader variety of games, it has no known <a href="#AltTab">alt-tab issues</a>, and it is capable of firing AutoHotkey's hook hotkeys  (whereas AutoHotkey's remapping requires a <a href="#HookHotkeys">workaround</a>).</li>
  <li>If you choose to make the registry entries manually (explained below), absolutely no external software is needed to remap your keyboard. Even if you use <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/keytweak/">KeyTweak</a> to make the registry entries for you, KeyTweak does not need to stay running all the time (unlike AutoHotkey).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Registry remapping is relatively permanent: a reboot is required to undo the changes or put new ones into effect.</li>
  <li>Its effect is global: it cannot create remappings specific to a particular user, application, or locale.</li>
  <li>It cannot send keystrokes that are modified by <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, or <kbd>AltGr</kbd>. For example, it cannot remap a lowercase character to an uppercase one.</li>
  <li>It supports only the keyboard (AutoHotkey has <a href="#RemapMouse">mouse remapping</a> and some <a href="RemapJoystick.htm">limited joystick remapping</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Apply Changes to the Registry:</strong> There are at least two methods to remap keys via the registry:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use a program like <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/keytweak/">KeyTweak</a> (freeware) to visually remap your keys. It will change the registry for you.</li>
  <li>Remap keys manually by creating a .reg file (plain text) and loading it into the registry. This is demonstrated in the <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/board/index.php?showtopic=8359#entry52760">archived forums</a>.</li>

<h2 id="imp">Important Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Although a joystick button or axis can be remapped to become a key or mouse button, it cannot be remapped to some other joystick button or axis. That would be possible only with the help of a joystick emulator such as <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/">vJoy</a>.</li>
  <li>AutoHotkey identifies each button on a joystick with a unique number between 1 and 32. To determine these numbers, use the <a href="../scripts/index.htm#JoystickTest">joystick test script</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="button">Making a Joystick Button Send Keystrokes or Mouse Clicks</h2>

<h3 id="different-approaches">Different Approaches</h3>
<p>Below are three approaches, starting at the simplest and ending with the most complex. The most complex method works in the broadest variety of circumstances (such as games that require a key or mouse button to be held down).</p>

<h4 id="Method_1">Method #1</h4>
<p>This method sends simple keystrokes and mouse clicks. For example:</p>
<pre>Joy1::<a href="../lib/Send.htm">Send</a> "{Left}"  <em>; Have button #1 send a left-arrow keystroke.</em>
Joy2::<a href="../lib/Click.htm">Click</a>  <em>; Have button #2 send a click of left mouse button.</em>
Joy3::Send "a{Esc}{Space}{Enter}"  <em>; Have button #3 send the letter "a" followed by Escape, Space, and Enter.</em>
Joy4::Send "Sincerely,{Enter}John Smith"  <em>; Have button #4 send a two-line signature.</em></pre>
<p>To have a button perform more than one function, put the first function <em>beneath</em> the button name and make the last line a <a href="../lib/Return.htm">return</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>Joy5::
{
    Run "notepad"
    WinWait "Untitled - Notepad"
    WinActivate
    Send "This is the text that will appear in Notepad.{Enter}"
}</pre>
<p>See the <a href="../KeyList.htm">Key List</a> for the complete list of keys and mouse/joystick buttons.</p>

<h4 id="Method_2">Method #2</h4>
<p>This method is necessary in cases where a key or mouse button must be held down for the entire time that you're holding down a joystick button. The following example makes the joystick's second button become the left-arrow key:</p>
<pre>Joy2::
{
    Send "{Left down}"  <em>; Hold down the left-arrow key.</em>
    <a href="../lib/KeyWait.htm">KeyWait</a> "Joy2"  <em>; Wait for the user to release the joystick button.</em>
    Send "{Left up}"  <em>; Release the left-arrow key.</em>
}</pre>

<h4 id="Method_3">Method #3</h4>
<p>This method is necessary in cases where you have more than one joystick hotkey of the type described in Method #2, and you sometimes press and release such hotkeys simultaneously. The following example makes the joystick's third button become the left mouse button:</p>
<pre>Joy3::
{
    Send "{LButton down}"   <em>; Hold down the left mouse button.</em>
    SetTimer WaitForButtonUp3, 10
}

WaitForButtonUp3()
{
    if <a href="../lib/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a>("Joy3")  <em>; The button is still, down, so keep waiting.</em>
        return
    <em>; Otherwise, the button has been released.</em>
    Send "{LButton up}"  <em>; Release the left mouse button.</em>
    SetTimer , 0
}
</pre>

<h3 id="auto-repeating-joystick-buttons">Auto-repeating a Keystroke</h3>
<p>Some programs or games might require a key to be sent repeatedly (as though you are holding it down on the keyboard). The following example achieves this by sending spacebar keystrokes repeatedly while you hold down the joystick's second button:</p>
<pre>Joy2::
{
    Send "{Space down}"   <em>; Press the spacebar down.</em>
    SetTimer WaitForJoy2, <strong>30</strong>  <em>; Reduce the number <strong>30</strong> to 20 or 10 to send keys faster. Increase it to send slower.</em>
}

WaitForJoy2()
{
    if not GetKeyState("Joy2")  <em>; The button has been released.</em>
    {
        Send "{Space up}"  <em>; Release the spacebar.</em>
        SetTimer , 0  <em>; Stop monitoring the button.</em>
        return
    }
    <em>; Since above didn't "return", the button is still being held down.</em>
    Send "{Space down}"  <em>; Send another Spacebar keystroke.</em>
}</pre>

<h3 id="context-sensitive-joystick-buttons">Context-sensitive Joystick Buttons</h3>
<p>The <a href="../lib/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> directive can be used to make selected joystick buttons perform a different action (or none at all) depending on any condition, such as the type of window that is active.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-joystick-as-a-mouse">Using a Joystick as a Mouse</h3>
<p>The <a href="../scripts/index.htm#JoystickMouse">Joystick-To-Mouse script</a> converts a joystick into a mouse by remapping its buttons and axis control.</p>

<h2 id="axis">Making Other Joystick Controls Send Keystrokes or Mouse Clicks</h2>
<p>To have a script respond to movement of a joystick's axis or POV hat, use <a href="../lib/SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a> and <a href="../lib/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a>.</p>

<h3 id="joystick-axes">Joystick Axes</h3>
<p>The following example makes the joystick's X and Y axes behave like the arrow key cluster on a keyboard (left, right, up, and down):</p>
<pre><a href="../lib/SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a> WatchAxis, 5

WatchAxis()
{
    static KeyToHoldDown := ""
    JoyX := <a href="../lib/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a>("JoyX")  <em>; Get position of X axis.</em>
    JoyY := GetKeyState("JoyY")  <em>; Get position of Y axis.</em>
    KeyToHoldDownPrev := KeyToHoldDown  <em>; Prev now holds the key that was down before (if any).</em>

    if JoyX &gt; 70
        KeyToHoldDown := "Right"
    else if JoyX &lt; 30
        KeyToHoldDown := "Left"
    else if JoyY &gt; 70
        KeyToHoldDown := "Down"
    else if JoyY &lt; 30
        KeyToHoldDown := "Up"
    else
        KeyToHoldDown := ""

    if KeyToHoldDown = KeyToHoldDownPrev  <em>; The correct key is already down (or no key is needed).</em>
        return  <em>; Do nothing.</em>

    <em>; Otherwise, release the previous key and press down the new key:</em>
    SetKeyDelay -1  <em>; Avoid delays between keystrokes.</em>
    if KeyToHoldDownPrev   <em>; There is a previous key to release.</em>
        Send "{" KeyToHoldDownPrev " up}"  <em>; Release it.</em>
    if KeyToHoldDown   <em>; There is a key to press down.</em>
        Send "{" KeyToHoldDown " down}"  <em>; Press it down.</em>
}</pre>

<h3 id="joystick-pov-hat">Joystick POV Hat</h3>
<p>The following example makes the joystick's POV hat behave like the arrow key cluster on a keyboard; that is, the POV hat will send arrow keystrokes (left, right, up, and down):</p>
<pre>SetTimer WatchPOV, 5

WatchPOV()
{
    static KeyToHoldDown := ""
    POV := GetKeyState("JoyPOV")  <em>; Get position of the POV control.</em>
    KeyToHoldDownPrev := KeyToHoldDown  <em>; Prev now holds the key that was down before (if any).</em>

    <em>; Some joysticks might have a smooth/continous POV rather than one in fixed increments.
    ; To support them all, use a range:</em>

<h3 id="auto-repeating-other">Auto-repeating a Keystroke</h3>
<p>Both examples above can be modified to send the key repeatedly rather than merely holding it down (that is, they can mimic physically holding down a key on the keyboard). To do this, replace the following line:</p>
<pre>return  <em>; Do nothing.</em></pre>
<p>With the following:</p>
<pre>{
    if KeyToHoldDown
        Send "{" KeyToHoldDown " down}"  <em>; Auto-repeat the keystroke.</em>
    return
}</pre>

<p>A joystick other than first may be used by preceding the button or axis name with the number of the joystick. For example, <code>2Joy1</code> would be the second joystick's first button.</p>
<p>To find other useful joystick scripts, visit the <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/forum/">AutoHotkey forum</a>. A keyword search such as <em>Joystick and GetKeyState and Send</em> is likely to produce topics of interest.</p>

<h1>PostMessage / SendMessage Tutorial <span class="headnote">by Rajat</span></h1>

<p>This page explains how to send messages to a window or its controls via <a href="../lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a> or <a href="../lib/SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> and will answer some questions like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"How do I press a button on a minimized window?"</li>
  <li>"How do I select a menu item when <a href="../lib/MenuSelect.htm">MenuSelect</a> doesn't work with it?!"</li>
  <li>"This is a skinnable window.... how do I send a command that works every time?"</li>
  <li>"and what about <strong>hidden</strong> windows?!"</li>
</ul>
<p>Requirements: Winspector Spy (<a href="https://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Security-Related/Winspector.shtml">can be found here</a>)</p>
<p>As a first example, note that <a href="../lib/MenuSelect.htm">MenuSelect</a> fails to work with the menu bar on Outlook Express's "New Message" window. In other words, this code will not work:</p>
<pre>MenuSelect "New Message",, "&amp;Insert", "&amp;Picture..."</pre>
<p>But <a href="../lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a> can get the job done:</p>
<pre>PostMessage 0x0111, 40239, 0, , "New Message"</pre>
<p>Works like a charm! But what the heck is that? 0x0111 is the hex code of <a href="SendMessageList.htm">wm_command message</a> and 40239 is the code that this particular window understands as menu-item 'Insert Picture' selection. Now let me tell you how to find a value such as 40239:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Winspector Spy and a "New Message" window.</li>
  <li>Drag the crosshair from Winspector Spy's window to "New Message" window's titlebar (the portion not covered by Winspector Spy's overlay).</li>
  <li>Right click the selected window in the list on left and select 'Messages'.</li>
  <li>Right click the blank window and select 'Edit message filter'.</li>
  <li>Press the 'filter all' button and then dbl click 'wm_command' on the list on left. This way you will only monitor this message.</li>
  <li>Now go to the "New Message" window and select from its menu bar: Insert &gt; Picture.</li>
  <li>Come back to Winspector Spy and press the traffic light button to pause monitoring.</li>
  <li>Expand the wm_command messages that've accumulated (forget others if any).</li>
  <li>What you want to look for (usually) is a code 0 message. sometimes there are wm_command messages saying 'win activated' or 'win destroyed' and other stuff.. not needed. You'll find that there's a message saying 'Control ID: 40239' ...that's it!</li>
  <li>Now put that in the above function and you've got it! It's the wParam value.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the next example I'm taking Paint because possibly everyone will have that. Now let's say it's an app where you have to select a tool from a toolbar using AutoHotkey; say the dropper tool is to be selected.</p>
<p>What will you do? Most probably a mouse click at the toolbar button, right? But toolbars can be moved and hidden! This one can be moved/hidden too. So if the target user has done any of this then your script will fail at that point. But the following function will still work:</p>
<pre>PostMessage 0x0111, 639,,, "Untitled - Paint"</pre>
<p>Another advantage to <a href="../lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a> is that the Window can be in the background; by contrast, sending mouse clicks would require it to be active.</p>
<p>Here are some more examples. Note: I'm using WinXP Pro (SP1) ... if you use a different OS then your params may change (only applicable to apps like Wordpad and Notepad that come with windows; for others the params shouldn't vary):</p>
<pre><em>;makes writing color teal in Wordpad</em>
<a href="../lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a> 0x0111, 32788, 0, , "Document - WordPad"</pre>
<pre><em>;opens about box in Notepad</em>
<a href="../lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a> 0x0111, 65, 0, , "Untitled - Notepad"</pre>
<pre><em>;toggles word-wrap in Notepad</em>
<a href="../lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a> 0x0111, 32, 0, , "Untitled - Notepad"</pre>
<pre><em>;play/pause in Windows Media Player</em>
<a href="../lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a> 0x0111, 32808, 0, , "Windows Media Player"</pre>
<pre><em>;suspend the hotkeys of a running AHK script</em>
DetectHiddenWindows True
<em>; Use 65306 to Pause and 65303 to Reload instead of Suspend. (see <a href="../FAQ.htm#close">FAQ</a>)</em>
<a href="../lib/PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a> 0x0111, 65305,,, "MyScript.ahk - AutoHotkey"
</pre>
<pre><em>; Press CapsLock and Numpad2 to reload all AutoHotkey scripts</em>
CapsLock &amp; Numpad2::
ReloadAllAhkScripts(ThisHotkey)
{
    DetectHiddenWindows True
    for hwnd in WinGetList("ahk_class AutoHotkey")
    {
        if (hwnd = A_ScriptHwnd)  <em>; ignore the current window for reloading</em>
            continue
        PostMessage 0x0111, 65303,,, hwnd
    }
    Reload
}
</pre>
<p>This above was for PostMessage. <a href="../lib/SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> works the same way but additionally waits for a return value, which can be used for things such as getting the currently playing track in Winamp (see <a href="Winamp.htm">Automating Winamp</a> for an example).</p>
<p>Here are some more notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The note above regarding OS being XP and msg values changing with different OSes is purely cautionary. if you've found a msg that works on your system (with a certain version of a software) then you can be sure it'll work on another system too with the same version of the software. In addition, most apps keep these msg values the same even on different versions of themselves (e.g. Windows Media Player and Winamp).</li>
  <li>If you've set the filter to show only wm_command in Winspector Spy and still you're getting a flood of messages then right click that message and select hide (msg name)... you don't want to have a look at a msg that appears without you interacting with the target software.</li>
  <li>The right pointing arrow in Winspector Spy shows the msg values and the blurred left pointing arrows show the returned value. A 0 (zero) value can by default safely be taken as 'no error' (use it with SendMessage).</li>
  <li>For posting to hidden windows add this to script: <code>DetectHiddenWindows True</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: There are apps with which this technique doesn't work. I've had mixed luck with VB and Delphi apps. This technique is best used with C, C++ apps. With VB apps the 'LParam' of the same function keeps changing from one run to another. With Delphi apps... the GUI of some apps doesn't even use wm_command. It probably uses mouse pos &amp; clicks.</p>
<p>Go and explore.... and share your experiences in the AutoHotkey Forum. Feedback is welcome!</p>
<p>This tutorial is not meant for total newbies (no offense meant) since these functions are considered advanced features. So if after reading the above you've not made heads or tails of it, please forget it.</p>

<title>Threads - Behaviour &amp; Priority | AutoHotkey v2</title>

<script src="../static/content.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<body>
<h1>Threads</h1>

<p>The <em>current thread</em> is defined as the flow of execution invoked by the most recent event; examples include <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a>, <a href="../lib/SetTimer.htm">SetTimer subroutines</a>, <a href="../lib/Menu.htm">custom menu items</a>, and <a href="../lib/Gui.htm#Events">GUI events</a>. The <em>current thread</em> can be executing functions within its own subroutine or within other subroutines called by that subroutine.</p>
<p>Although AutoHotkey doesn't actually use multiple threads, it simulates some of that behavior: If a second thread is started -- such as by pressing another hotkey while the previous is still running -- the <em>current thread</em> will be interrupted (temporarily halted) to allow the new thread to become <em>current</em>. If a third thread is started while the second is still running, both the second and first will be in a dormant state, and so on.</p>
<p>When the <em>current thread</em> finishes, the one most recently interrupted will be resumed, and so on, until all the threads finally finish. When resumed, a thread's settings for things such as <a href="../lib/SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> and <a href="../lib/SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a> are automatically restored to what they were just prior to its interruption; in other words, a thread will experience no side-effects from having been interrupted (except for a possible change in the <a href="../lib/WinActivate.htm">active window</a>).</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <a href="../lib/KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a> function/menu-item shows how many threads are in an interrupted state and the <a href="../lib/ListHotkeys.htm">ListHotkeys</a> function/menu-item shows which hotkeys have threads.</p>
<p>A single script can have multiple simultaneous <a href="../lib/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a>, <a href="../lib/InputBox.htm">InputBox</a>, <a href="../lib/FileSelect.htm">FileSelect</a>, and <a href="../lib/DirSelect.htm">DirSelect</a> dialogs. This is achieved by launching a new thread (via <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="../lib/SetTimer.htm">timed subroutine</a>, <a href="../lib/Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, etc.) while a prior thread already has a dialog displayed.</p>
<p>By default, a given <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> or <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstring</a> subroutine cannot be run a second time if it is already running. Use <a href="../lib/_MaxThreadsPerHotkey.htm">#MaxThreadsPerHotkey</a> to change this behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> The <a href="../lib/Thread.htm">Thread</a> function sets the priority or interruptibility of threads.</p>

<h2 id="Priority">Thread Priority</h2>
<p>Any thread (<a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="../lib/SetTimer.htm">timed subroutine</a>, <a href="../lib/Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, etc.) with a priority lower than that of the <em>current thread</em> cannot interrupt it. During that time, such timers will not run, and any attempt by the user to create a thread (such as by pressing a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> or <a href="../lib/GuiControls.htm#Button">GUI button</a>) will have no effect, nor will it be buffered. Because of this, it is usually best to design high priority threads to finish quickly, or use <a href="../lib/Critical.htm">Critical</a> instead of making them high priority.</p>
<p>The default priority is 0. All threads use the default priority unless changed by one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A timed subroutine is given a specific priority via <a href="../lib/SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a>.</li>
  <li>A hotkey is given a specific priority via the <a href="../lib/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> function.</li>
  <li>A <a href="../Hotstrings.htm">hotstring</a> is given a specific priority when it is defined, or via the <a href="../lib/_Hotstring.htm">#Hotstring</a> directive.</li>
  <li>A custom menu item is given a specific priority via the <a href="../lib/Menu.htm#Add">Menu.Add</a> method.</li>
  <li>The <em>current thread</em> sets its own priority via the <a href="../lib/Thread.htm">Thread</a> function.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="../lib/OnExit.htm">OnExit</a> callback function (if any) will always run when called for, regardless of the <em>current thread</em>'s priority.</p>

<h2 id="Interrupt">Thread Interruptibility</h2>
<p>For most types of events, new threads are permitted to launch only if the current thread is <em>interruptible</em>. A thread can be <em>uninterruptible</em> for a number of reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The thread has been marked as <em>critical</em>. <a href="../lib/Critical.htm">Critical</a> may have been called by the thread itself or by <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">the auto-execute thread</a>.</li>
  <li>The thread has not been running long enough to meet the conditions for becoming interruptible, as set by <a href="../lib/Thread.htm#Interrupt">Thread "Interrupt"</a>.</li>
  <li>One of the script's menus is being displayed (such as the tray icon menu or a menu bar).</li>
  <li>A delay is being performed by <a href="../lib/Send.htm">Send</a> (most often due to <a href="../lib/SetKeyDelay.htm">SetKeyDelay</a>), <a href="../lib/WinActivate.htm">WinActivate</a>, or a <a href="../lib/A_Clipboard.htm">Clipboard</a> operation.</li>
  <li>An <a href="../lib/OnExit.htm">OnExit</a> thread is executing.</li>
  <li>A warning dialog is being displayed due to the <a href="../lib/A_MaxHotkeysPerInterval.htm">A_MaxHotkeysPerInterval</a> limit being reached, or due to a problem activating the keyboard or mouse hook (very rare).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Behave">Behavior of Uninterruptible Threads</h3>
<p>Unlike high-priority threads, events that occur while the thread is uninterruptible are not discarded. For example, if the user presses a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> while the current thread is uninterruptible, the hotkey is buffered indefinitely until the current thread finishes or becomes interruptible, at which time the hotkey is launched as a new thread.</p>
<p>Any thread may be interrupted in emergencies. Emergencies consist of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An <a href="../lib/OnExit.htm">OnExit</a> callback.</li>
  <li>Any <a href="../lib/OnMessage.htm">OnMessage</a> function that monitors a message which is not <a href="../lib/OnMessage.htm#buffering">buffered</a>.</li>
  <li>Any <a href="../lib/CallbackCreate.htm">callback</a> indirectly triggered by the thread itself (e.g. via <a href="../lib/PostMessage.htm">SendMessage</a> or <a href="../lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid these interruptions, temporarily disable such functions.</p>
<p>A <a href="../lib/Critical.htm">critical</a> thread becomes interruptible when a <a href="../lib/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a> or other dialog is displayed. However, unlike <a href="../lib/Thread.htm">Thread Interrupt</a>, the thread becomes critical (and therefore uninterruptible) again after the user dismisses the dialog.</p>

<h1>Automating Winamp</h1>

<p>This section demonstrates how to control Winamp via hotkey even when it is minimized or inactive. This information has been tested with Winamp 2.78c but should work for other major releases as well. Please post changes and improvements in the forum or contact the author.</p>
<p>This example makes the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> hotkey equivalent to pressing Winamp's pause/unpause button:</p>
<pre>^!p::
{
    if not WinExist("ahk_class Winamp v1.x")
        return
<em>; Otherwise, the above has set the "last found" window for use below.</em>
<a href="../lib/ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a> "c"  <em>; Pause/Unpause</em>
}</pre>
<p>Here are some of the keyboard shortcuts available in Winamp 2.x (may work in other versions too). The above example can be revised to use any of these keys:</p>
<table class="info" style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th style="width:29%">Key to send</th>
    <th>Effect</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>c</code></td>
    <td>Pause/UnPause</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>x</code></td>
    <td>Play/Restart/UnPause</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>v</code></td>
    <td>Stop</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>+v</code></td>
    <td>Stop with Fadeout</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>^v</code></td>
    <td>Stop after the current track</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>b</code></td>
    <td>Next Track</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>z</code></td>
    <td>Previous Track</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>{left}</code></td>
    <td>Rewind 5 seconds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>{right}</code></td>
    <td>Fast-forward 5 seconds</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>{up}</code></td>
    <td>Turn Volume Up</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>{down}</code></td>
    <td>Turn Volume Down</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The following example asks Winamp which track number is currently active:</p>
<pre>
TrackNumber := <a href="../lib/SendMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>(0x0400, 0, 120,, "ahk_class Winamp v1.x")
if (TrackNumber != "")
{
    TrackNumber += 1  <em>; Winamp's count starts at 0, so adjust by 1.</em>
    MsgBox "Track #" TrackNumber " is active or playing."
}</pre>

<h1><var>WinTitle</var> Parameter &amp; Last Found Window</h1>

<p>Various built-in functions have a <var>WinTitle</var> parameter, used to identify which window (or windows) to operate on. This parameter can be the title or partial title of the window, and/or any other criteria described on this page.</p>

<strong>Quick Reference:</strong>
<table id="QuickRef">
  <tr><td><em>Title</em></td><td><a href="#Matching">Matching Behaviour</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td><em>Integer</em></td><td><a href="#ahk_id">HWND</a></td></tr>

</table>

<h2 id="Matching">Matching Behaviour</h2>
<p><a href="../lib/SetTitleMatchMode.htm">SetTitleMatchMode</a> controls how a partial or complete title is compared against the title of each window. Depending on the setting, <var>WinTitle</var> can be an exact title, or it can contain a prefix, a substring which occurs anywhere in the title, or a <a href="RegEx-QuickRef.htm">RegEx pattern</a>. This setting also controls whether the <a href="#ahk_class">ahk_class</a> and <a href="#ahk_exe">ahk_exe</a> criteria are interpreted as RegEx patterns.</p>
<p>Window titles are case sensitive, except when using the <a href="RegEx-QuickRef.htm#opt_i">i) modifier</a> in a RegEx pattern.</p>
<p>Hidden windows are only detected if <a href="../lib/DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> is turned on, except with <a href="../lib/WinShow.htm">WinShow</a>, which always detects hidden windows.</p>
<p>If multiple windows match <var>WinTitle</var> and any other criteria, the topmost matching window is used. If the active window matches the criteria, it usually takes precedence since it is usually above all other windows. However, if an <a href="../lib/WinSetAlwaysOnTop.htm">always-on-top</a> window also matches (and the active window is not always-on-top), it may be used instead.</p>

<h2 id="ActiveWindow">A (Active Window)</h2>
<p>Use the letter <code>A</code> for <var>WinTitle</var> and omit the other three window parameters (<em>WinText</em>, <em>ExcludeTitle</em> and <em>ExcludeText</em>), to operate on the active window.</p>
<p>The following example retrieves and reports the unique ID (HWND) of the active window:</p>
<pre>MsgBox WinExist("A")</pre>
<p>The following example creates a hotkey which can be pressed to maximize the active window:</p>
<pre>#Up::WinMaximize "A"  <em>; Win+Up</em></pre>

<h2 id="ahk_">ahk_ Criteria</h2>
<p>Specify one or more of the following ahk_ criteria (optionally in addition to a window's title). An ahk_ criterion always consists of an ahk_ keyword and its criterion value, both separated by zero or more spaces or tabs. For example, <code>ahk_class Notepad</code> represents a Notepad window.</p>
<p>The ahk_ keyword and its criterion value do not need to be separated by spaces or tabs. This is primarily useful when specifying ahk_ criteria in combination with variables. For example, you could specify <code>"ahk_pid" PID</code> instead of <code>"ahk_pid " PID</code>. In all other cases, however, it is recommended to use at least one space or tab as a separation to improve readability.</p>

<h3 id="ahk_class">ahk_class (Window Class)</h3>
<p>Use <code>ahk_class <var>ClassName</var></code> in <var>WinTitle</var> to identify a window by its window class.</p>
<p>A window class is a set of attributes that the system uses as a template to create a window. In other words, the class name of the window identifies what <em>type</em> of window it is. A window class can be revealed via Window Spy or retrieved by <a href="../lib/WinGetClass.htm">WinGetClass</a>. If the RegEx <a href="../lib/SetTitleMatchMode.htm">title matching mode</a> is active, <var>ClassName</var> accepts a <a href="RegEx-QuickRef.htm">regular expression</a>.</p>
<p>The following example activates a console window (e.g. cmd.exe):</p>
<pre>WinActivate "ahk_class ConsoleWindowClass"</pre>
<p>The following example does the same as above, but uses a <a href="RegEx-QuickRef.htm">regular expression</a> (note that the RegEx <a href="../lib/SetTitleMatchMode.htm">title matching mode</a> must be turned on beforehand to make it work):</p>
<pre>WinActivate "ahk_class i)^ConsoleWindowClass$"</pre>

<h3 id="ahk_id">ahk_id (Unique ID / HWND)</h3>
<p>Each window or control has a unique ID, also known as a HWND (short for handle to window). This ID can be used to identify the window or control even if its title changes.</p>
<p>Use <code>ahk_id <var>HWND</var></code>, <code><var>HWND</var></code> (that is, an <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> without the ahk_id keyword) or an <a href="../Objects.htm">Object</a> with a HWND property in <var>WinTitle</var> to identify a window or control by its unique ID.</p>
<p><a href="../lib/DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> affects whether the ahk_id criterion detects hidden top-level windows, but hidden controls are always detected. It also affects whether hidden windows identified by HWND (as an Object property or Integer) are detected, but only when used with <a href="../lib/WinWait.htm">WinWait</a> or <a href="../lib/WinWaitClose.htm">WinWaitClose</a>.</p>
<p>The ahk_id criterion can also be combined with other criteria that the given window must match. For example, <code>WinExist("ahk_id " ahwnd " ahk_class " aclass)</code> returns <var>ahwnd</var> if the window is "detected" (according to DetectHiddenWindows) and its window class matches the string contained by <var>aclass</var>.</p>
<p>The ID of a window is typically retrieved via <a href="../lib/WinExist.htm">WinExist</a> or <a href="../lib/WinGetID.htm">WinGetID</a>. The ID of a control is typically retrieved via <a href="../lib/ControlGetHwnd.htm">ControlGetHwnd</a>, <a href="../lib/MouseGetPos.htm">MouseGetPos</a>, or <a href="../lib/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>. <a href="../lib/Gui.htm">Gui</a> and <a href="../lib/GuiControl.htm">GuiControl</a> objects have a <code>Hwnd</code> property and therefore can be used directly in <var>WinTitle</var>.</p>
<p>The following examples operate on a window by a unique ID stored in <var>VarContainingID</var>:</p>
<pre><em>; Pass an <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a>.</em>
WinActivate Integer(VarContainingID)
WinShow A_ScriptHwnd
WinWaitNotActive WinExist("A")

<em>; Pass an <a href="../Objects.htm">Object</a> with a HWND property.</em>
WinActivate {Hwnd: VarContainingID}
WinWaitClose myGuiObject

<em>; Use the ahk_id prefix.</em>
WinActivate "ahk_id " VarContainingID
</pre>
<p>If the object has no HWND property or the property's value is not an integer, a <a href="../lib/Error.htm#PropertyError">PropertyError</a> or <a href="../lib/Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a> is thrown.</p>

<h3 id="ahk_pid">ahk_pid (Process ID)</h3>
<p>Use <code>ahk_pid <var>PID</var></code> in <var>WinTitle</var> to identify a window belonging to a specific process. The process identifier (PID) is typically retrieved by <a href="../lib/WinGetPID.htm">WinGetPID</a>, <a href="../lib/Run.htm">Run</a> or <a href="../lib/Process.htm">Process functions</a>. The ID of a window's process can be revealed via Window Spy.</p>
<p>The following example activates a window by a process ID stored in <var>VarContainingPID</var>:</p>
<pre>WinActivate "ahk_pid " VarContainingPID</pre>

<h3 id="ahk_exe">ahk_exe (Process Name/Path)</h3>
<p>Use <code>ahk_exe <var>ProcessNameOrPath</var></code> in <var>WinTitle</var> to identify a window belonging to any process with the given name or path.</p>
<p>While the <a href="#ahk_pid">ahk_pid criterion</a> is limited to one specific process, the ahk_exe criterion considers all processes with name or full path matching a given string. If the RegEx <a href="../lib/SetTitleMatchMode.htm">title matching mode</a> is active, <var>ProcessNameOrPath</var> accepts a <a href="RegEx-QuickRef.htm">regular expression</a> which must match the full path of the process. Otherwise, it accepts a case-insensitive name or full path; for example, <code>ahk_exe notepad.exe</code> covers <code>ahk_exe C:\Windows\Notepad.exe</code>, <code>ahk_exe C:\Windows\System32\Notepad.exe</code> and other variations. The name of a window's process can be revealed via Window Spy.</p>
<p>The following example activates a Notepad window by its process name:</p>
<pre>WinActivate "ahk_exe notepad.exe"</pre>
<p>The following example does the same as above, but uses a <a href="RegEx-QuickRef.htm">regular expression</a> (note that the RegEx <a href="../lib/SetTitleMatchMode.htm">title matching mode</a> must be turned on beforehand to make it work):</p>
<pre>WinActivate "ahk_exe i)\\notepad\.exe$"  <em>; Match the name part of the full path.</em></pre>

<h3 id="ahk_group">ahk_group (Window Group)</h3>
<p>Use <code>ahk_group <var>GroupName</var></code> in <var>WinTitle</var> to identify a window or windows matching the rules contained by a previously defined <a href="../lib/GroupAdd.htm">window group</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../lib/WinMinimize.htm">WinMinimize</a>, <a href="../lib/WinMaximize.htm">WinMaximize</a>, <a href="../lib/WinRestore.htm">WinRestore</a>, <a href="../lib/WinHide.htm">WinHide</a>, <a href="../lib/WinShow.htm">WinShow</a>, <a href="../lib/WinClose.htm">WinClose</a>, and <a href="../lib/WinKill.htm">WinKill</a> will act on <strong>all</strong> the group's windows. By contrast, the other window functions such as <a href="../lib/WinActivate.htm">WinActivate</a> and <a href="../lib/WinExist.htm">WinExist</a> will operate only on the topmost window of the group.</p>
<p>The following example activates any window matching the criteria defined by a window group:</p>
<pre><em>; Define the group: Windows Explorer windows</em>
GroupAdd "Explorer", "ahk_class ExploreWClass" <em>; Unused on Vista and later</em>
GroupAdd "Explorer", "ahk_class CabinetWClass"

<em>; Activate any window matching the above criteria</em>
WinActivate "ahk_group Explorer"</pre>

<h2 id="multi">Multiple Criteria</h2>
<p>By contrast with the <a href="#ahk_group">ahk_group criterion</a> (which broadens the search), the search may be narrowed by specifying more than one criterion within the <var>WinTitle</var> parameter. In the following example, the script waits for a window whose title contains <em>My File.txt</em> <strong>and</strong> whose class is <em>Notepad</em>:</p>
<pre>WinWait "<strong>My File.txt</strong> ahk_class <strong>Notepad</strong>"
WinActivate  <em>; Activate the window it found.</em></pre>
<p>When using this method, the text of the title (if any is desired) should be listed first, followed by one or more additional criteria. Criteria beyond the first should be separated from the previous with exactly one space or tab (any other spaces or tabs are treated as a literal part of the previous criterion).</p>
<p>The <a href="#ahk_id">ahk_id criterion</a> can be combined with other criteria to test a window's title, class or other attributes:</p>
<pre>
MouseGetPos ,, &amp;id
if WinExist("ahk_class Notepad ahk_id " id)
    MsgBox "The mouse is over Notepad."
</pre>


<h2 id="LastFoundWindow">Last Found Window</h2>

<p>This is the window most recently found by <a href="../lib/WinExist.htm">WinExist</a>, <a href="../lib/WinActive.htm">WinActive</a>, <a href="../lib/WinWaitActive.htm">WinWait[Not]Active</a>, or <a href="../lib/WinWait.htm">WinWait</a>. It can make scripts easier to create and maintain since <var>WinTitle</var> and <var>WinText</var> of the target window do not need to be repeated for every windowing function. In addition, scripts perform better because they don't need to search for the target window again after it has been found the first time.</p>
<p>The last found window can be used by all of the windowing functions except <a href="../lib/WinWait.htm">WinWait</a>, <a href="../lib/WinActivateBottom.htm">WinActivateBottom</a>, <a href="../lib/GroupAdd.htm">GroupAdd</a>, <a href="../lib/WinGetCount.htm">WinGetCount</a>, and <a href="../lib/WinGetList.htm">WinGetList</a>. To use it, simply omit all four window parameters (<var>WinTitle</var>, <var>WinText</var>, <var>ExcludeTitle</var>, and <var>ExcludeText</var>).</p>
<p>Each <a href="Threads.htm">thread</a> retains its own value of the last found window, meaning that if the <a href="Threads.htm">current thread</a> is interrupted by another, when the original thread is resumed it will still have its original value of the last found window, not that of the interrupting thread.</p>
<p>If the last found window is a hidden <a href="../lib/Gui.htm">Gui window</a>, it can be used even when <a href="../lib/DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> is turned off. This is often used in conjunction with the GUI's <a href="../lib/Gui.htm#LastFound">+LastFound</a> option.</p>
<p>The following example opens Notepad, waits until it exists and activates it:</p>
<pre>Run "Notepad"
WinWait "Untitled - Notepad"
WinActivate <em>; Use the window found by WinWait.</em></pre>

<p>The following example activates and maximizes the Notepad window found by WinExist:</p>
<pre>if WinExist("Untitled - Notepad")
{
    WinActivate <em>; Use the window found by WinExist.</em>
    WinMaximize <em>; Same as above.</em>
    Send "Some text.{Enter}"
}</pre>

<p>The following example activates the calculator found by WinExist and moves it to a new position:</p>
<pre>if not WinExist("Calculator")
{
    <em>; ...</em>
}
else
{
    WinActivate <em>; Use the window found by WinExist.</em>
    WinMove 40, 40 <em>; Same as above.</em>
}</pre>

﻿; Easy Window Dragging -- KDE style (based on the v1 script by Jonny) 
; https://www.autohotkey.com
; This script makes it much easier to move or resize a window: 1) Hold down
; the ALT key and LEFT-click anywhere inside a window to drag it to a new
; location; 2) Hold down ALT and RIGHT-click-drag anywhere inside a window
; to easily resize it; 3) Press ALT twice, but before releasing it the second
; time, left-click to minimize the window under the mouse cursor, right-click
; to maximize it, or middle-click to close it.

; The Double-Alt modifier is activated by pressing
; Alt twice, much like a double-click. Hold the second
; press down until you click.
;
; The shortcuts:
;  Alt + Left Button  : Drag to move a window.
;  Alt + Right Button : Drag to resize a window.
;  Double-Alt + Left Button   : Minimize a window.
;  Double-Alt + Right Button  : Maximize/Restore a window.
;  Double-Alt + Middle Button : Close a window.
;
; You can optionally release Alt after the first
; click rather than holding it down the whole time.

﻿; HTML Entities Encoding

; string into its HTML equivalent by translating characters whose ASCII
; values are above 127 to their HTML names (e.g. £ becomes &pound;). In
; addition, the four characters "&<> are translated to &quot;&amp;&lt;&gt;.
; Finally, each linefeed (`n) is translated to <br>`n (i.e. <br> followed
; by a linefeed).

; In addition of the functionality above, Flags can be zero or a
; combination (sum) of the following values. If omitted, it defaults to 1.

; - 1: Converts certain characters to named expressions. e.g. € is

; - 2: Converts certain characters to numbered expressions. e.g. € is
;      converted to &#8364;

}﻿; Easy Access to Favorite Folders (based on the v1 script by Savage)
; https://www.autohotkey.com
; When you click the middle mouse button while certain types of
; windows are active, this script displays a menu of your favorite
; folders.  Upon selecting a favorite, the script will instantly
; switch to that folder within the active window.  The following
; window types are supported: 1) Standard file-open or file-save
; dialogs; 2) Explorer windows; 3) Console (command prompt) windows.
; The menu can also be optionally shown for unsupported window
; types, in which case the chosen favorite will be opened as a new
; Explorer window.

; CONFIG: CHOOSE YOUR HOTKEY
; If your mouse has more than 3 buttons, you could try using
; XButton1 (the 4th) or XButton2 (the 5th) instead of MButton.
; You could also use a modified mouse button (such as ^MButton) or
; a keyboard hotkey.  In the case of MButton, the tilde (~) prefix
; is used so that MButton's normal functionality is not lost when
; you click in other window types, such as a browser.  The presence
; of a tilde tells the script to avoid showing the menu for
; unsupported window types.  In other words, if there is no tilde,
; the hotkey will always display the menu; and upon selecting a
; favorite while an unsupported window type is active, a new
; Explorer window will be opened to display the contents of that
; folder.

<h2 id="ContextSensitiveHelp">Context Sensitive Help in Any Editor</h2>
<p>Based on the v1 script by Rajat</p>
<p>This script makes <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> (or another hotkey of your choice) show the help file page for the selected AutoHotkey function or keyword. If nothing is selected, the function name will be extracted from the beginning of the current line.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="ContextSensitiveHelp.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="EasyWindowDrag">Easy Window Dragging</h2>
<p>Normally, a window can only be dragged by clicking on its title bar. This script extends that so that any point inside a window can be dragged. To activate this mode, hold down <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> or the middle mouse button while clicking, then drag the window to a new position.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="EasyWindowDrag.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="EasyWindowDrag_(KDE)">Easy Window Dragging (KDE style)</h2>
<p>Based on the v1 script by Jonny</p>
<p>This script makes it much easier to move or resize a window: 1) Hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd> and LEFT-click anywhere inside a window to drag it to a new location; 2) Hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd> and RIGHT-click-drag anywhere inside a window to easily resize it; 3) Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> twice, but before releasing it the second time, left-click to minimize the window under the mouse cursor, right-click to maximize it, or middle-click to close it.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="EasyWindowDrag_(KDE).ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="FavoriteFolders">Easy Access to Favorite Folders</h2>
<p>Based on the v1 script by Savage</p>
<p>When you click the middle mouse button while certain types of windows are active, this script displays a menu of your favorite folders. Upon selecting a favorite, the script will instantly switch to that folder within the active window. The following window types are supported: 1) Standard file-open or file-save dialogs; 2) Explorer windows; 3) Console (command prompt) windows. The menu can also be optionally shown for unsupported window types, in which case the chosen favorite will be opened as a new Explorer window.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="FavoriteFolders.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="IntelliSense">IntelliSense</h2>
<p>Based on the v1 script by Rajat</p>
<p>This script watches while you edit an AutoHotkey script. When it sees you type a command followed by a comma or space, it displays that command's parameter list to guide you. In addition, you can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> (or another hotkey of your choice) to display that command's page in the help file. To dismiss the parameter list, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="IntelliSense.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="JoystickMouse">Using a Joystick as a Mouse</h2>
<p>This script converts a joystick into a three-button mouse. It allows each button to drag just like a mouse button and it uses virtually no CPU time. Also, it will move the cursor faster depending on how far you push the joystick from center. You can personalize various settings at the top of the script.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="JoystickMouse.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="JoystickTest">Joystick Test Script</h2>
<p>This script helps determine the button numbers and other attributes of your joystick. It might also reveal if your joystick is in need of calibration; that is, whether the range of motion of each of its axes is from 0 to 100 percent as it should be. If calibration is needed, use the operating system's control panel or the software that came with your joystick.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="JoystickTest.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="KeyboardOnScreen">On-Screen Keyboard</h2>
<p>Based on the v1 script by Jon</p>
<p>This script creates a mock keyboard at the bottom of your screen that shows the keys you are pressing in real time. I made it to help me to learn to touch-type (to get used to not looking at the keyboard). The size of the on-screen keyboard can be customized at the top of the script. Also, you can double-click the tray icon to show or hide the keyboard.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="KeyboardOnScreen.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="MinimizeToTrayMenu">Minimize Window to Tray Menu</h2>
<p>This script assigns a hotkey of your choice to hide any window so that it becomes an entry at the bottom of the script's tray menu. Hidden windows can then be unhidden individually or all at once by selecting the corresponding item on the menu. If the script exits for any reason, all the windows that it hid will be unhidden automatically.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="MinimizeToTrayMenu.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="MsgBoxButtonNames">Changing MsgBox's Button Names</h2>
<p>This is a working example script that uses a timer to change the names of the buttons in a message box. Although the button names are changed, the MsgBox's return value still requires that the buttons be referred to by their original names.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="MsgBoxButtonNames.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="Numpad000">Numpad 000 Key</h2>
<p>This example script makes the special <kbd>000</kbd> that appears on certain keypads into an equals key. You can change the action by replacing the <code>Send "="</code> line with line(s) of your choice.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="Numpad000.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="NumpadMouse">Using Keyboard Numpad as a Mouse</h2>
<p>Based on the v1 script by deguix</p>
<p>This script makes mousing with your keyboard almost as easy as using a real mouse (maybe even easier for some tasks). It supports up to five mouse buttons and the turning of the mouse wheel. It also features customizable movement speed, acceleration, and "axis inversion".</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="NumpadMouse.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="Seek_(SearchTheStartMenu)">Seek (Search the Start Menu)</h2>
<p>Based on the v1 script by Phi</p>
<p>Navigating the Start Menu can be a hassle, especially if you have installed many programs over time. 'Seek' lets you specify a case-insensitive key word/phrase that it will use to filter only the matching programs and directories from the Start Menu, so that you can easily open your target program from a handful of matched entries. This eliminates the drudgery of searching and traversing the Start Menu.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="Seek_(SearchTheStartMenu).ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="TooltipMouseMenu">ToolTip Mouse Menu</h2>
<p>Based on the v1 script by Rajat</p>
<p>This script displays a popup menu in response to briefly holding down the middle mouse button. Select a menu item by left-clicking it. Cancel the menu by left-clicking outside of it. A recent improvement is that the contents of the menu can change depending on which type of window is active (Notepad and Word are used as examples here).</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="TooltipMouseMenu.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="VolumeOSD">Volume On-Screen-Display (OSD)</h2>
<p>Based on the v1 script by Rajat</p>
<p>This script assigns hotkeys of your choice to raise and lower the master volume.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="VolumeOSD.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="WindowShading">Window Shading</h2>
<p>Based on the v1 script by Rajat</p>
<p>This script reduces a window to its title bar and then back to its original size by pressing a single hotkey. Any number of windows can be reduced in this fashion (the script remembers each). If the script exits for any reason, all "rolled up" windows will be automatically restored to their original heights.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="WindowShading.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="WinLIRC">WinLIRC Client</h2>
<p>This script receives notifications from <a href="http://winlirc.sourceforge.net">WinLIRC</a> whenever you press a button on your remote control. It can be used to automate Winamp, Windows Media Player, etc. It's easy to configure. For example, if WinLIRC recognizes a button named "VolUp" on your remote control, create a label named VolUp and beneath it use the function <code>SoundSetVolume "+5"</code> to increase the soundcard's volume by 5%.</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="WinLIRC.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="HTML_Entities_Encoding">HTML Entities Encoding</h2>
<p>Similar to AutoHotkey v1's <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/lib/Transform.htm#HTML">Transform HTML</a>, this function converts a string into its HTML equivalent by translating characters whose ASCII values are above 127 to their HTML names (e.g. <code>&pound;</code> becomes <code>&amp;pound;</code>). In addition, the four characters <code>"&amp;&lt;&gt;</code> are translated to <code>&amp;quot;&amp;amp;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;</code>. Finally, each linefeed (<code>`n</code>) is translated to <code>&lt;br&gt;`n</code> (i.e. <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> followed by a linefeed).</p>
<p class="show_code"><a href="EncodeHTML.ahk">Show code</a></p>

<h2 id="Scripts_and_Functions_Forum">AutoHotkey v1 Scripts and Functions Forum</h2>
<p>This forum contains many more scripts, but most scripts will not run as-is on AutoHotkey v2.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewforum.php?f=6">AutoHotkey v1 Scripts and Functions Forum</a></p>

﻿; IntelliSense (based on the v1 script by Rajat)
; https://www.autohotkey.com
; This script watches while you edit an AutoHotkey script.  When it sees you

; parameter list to guide you.  In addition, you can press Ctrl+F1 (or
; another hotkey of your choice) to display that command's page in the help
; file. To dismiss the parameter list, press Escape or Enter.

; help file:
g_HelpHotkey := "^F1"

; The string below must exist somewhere in the active window's title for
; IntelliSense to be in effect while you're typing.  Make it blank to have
; IntelliSense operate in all windows.  Make it Pad to have it operate in

; operate only when a .ahk file is open in Notepad, Metapad, etc.

﻿; Using a Joystick as a Mouse
; https://www.autohotkey.com
; This script converts a joystick into a three-button mouse.  It allows each
; button to drag just like a mouse button and it uses virtually no CPU time.
; Also, it will move the cursor faster depending on how far you push the joystick
; from center. You can personalize various settings at the top of the script.

; Increase the following value to make the mouse cursor move faster:
JoyMultiplier := 0.30

; Decrease the following value to require less joystick displacement-from-center
; to start moving the mouse.  However, you may need to calibrate your joystick
; -- ensuring it's properly centered -- to avoid cursor drift. A perfectly tight
; and centered joystick could use a value of 1:
JoyThreshold := 3

; Change the following to true to invert the Y-axis, which causes the mouse to
; move vertically in the direction opposite the stick:
InvertYAxis := false

; Change these values to use joystick button numbers other than 1, 2, and 3 for
; the left, right, and middle mouse buttons.  Available numbers are 1 through 32.
; Use the Joystick Test Script to find out your joystick's numbers more easily.
ButtonLeft := 1
ButtonRight := 2
ButtonMiddle := 3

; If your joystick has a POV control, you can use it as a mouse wheel.  The
; following value is the number of milliseconds between turns of the wheel.
; Decrease it to have the wheel turn faster:
WheelDelay := 250

; If your system has more than one joystick, increase this value to use a joystick
; other than the first:
JoystickNumber := 1

| a key for a long time, and the rotation which makes the    |
| numpad mouse to "turn". I.e. NumpadDown as NumpadUp        |
| and vice-versa. See the list of keys used below:           |

Seek (based on the v1 script by Phi)
http://www.autohotkey.com
Navigating the Start Menu can be a hassle, especially if you have installed
many programs over time. 'Seek' lets you specify a case-insensitive key
word/phrase that it will use to filter only the matching programs and
directories from the Start Menu, so that you can easily open your target
program from a handful of matched entries. This eliminates the drudgery of
searching and traversing the Start Menu.
*/
/*
Options:

-cache Use the cached directory-listing if available (this is the default mode
       when no option is specified)
-scan  Force a directory scan to retrieve the latest directory listing
-scex  Scan & exit (this is useful for scheduling the potentially
       time-consuming directory-scanning as a background job)
-help  Show this help

Important notes:

Check AutoHotkey's Tutorial how to run this script, or to compile it if
necessary.

The only file 'Seek' creates is placed in your TMP directory:

  a. _Seek.ini  (cache file for last query string and directory listing)

When you run 'Seek' for the first time, it'll scan your Start Menu,
and save the directory listing into a cache file.

The following directories are included in the scanning:
- A_StartMenu
- A_StartMenuCommon

By default, subsequent runs will read from the cache file so as to reduce the
loading time. For more info on options, run 'Seek.exe -help'. If you think your
Start Menu doesn't contain too many programs, you can choose not to use the
cache and instruct 'Seek' to always do a directory scan (via option -scan).
That way, you will always get the latest listing.

When you run 'Seek', a window will appear, waiting for you to enter a
key word/phrase. After you have entered a query string, a list of
matching records will be displayed. Next, you need to highlight an entry and
press ENTER or click on the 'Open' button to run the selected program or open
the selected directory.

﻿; WinLIRC Client
; https://www.autohotkey.com
; This script receives notifications from WinLIRC whenever you press
; a button on your remote control. It can be used to automate Winamp,
; Windows Media Player, etc. It's easy to configure. For example, if
; WinLIRC recognizes a button named "VolUp" on your remote control,
; create a label named VolUp and beneath it use the function
; <SoundSetVolume "+5"> to increase the soundcard's volume by 5%.

; Here are the steps to use this script:
; 1) Configure WinLIRC to recognize your remote control and its buttons.
;    WinLIRC is at http://winlirc.sourceforge.net
; 2) Edit the WinLIRC path, address, and port in the CONFIG section below.
; 3) Launch this script. It will start the WinLIRC server if needed.
; 4) Press some buttons on your remote control. A small window will
;    appear showing the name of each button as you press it.
; 5) Configure your buttons to send keystrokes and mouse clicks to
;    windows such as Winamp, Media Player, etc. See the examples below.

; -------------------------------------------------
; CONFIGURATION SECTION: Set your preferences here.
; -------------------------------------------------
; Some remote controls repeat the signal rapidly while you're holding down
; a button. This makes it difficult to get the remote to send only a single
; signal. The following setting solves this by ignoring repeated signals
; until the specified time has passed. 200 is often a good setting.  Set it
; to 0 to disable this feature.
g_DelayBetweenButtonRepeats := 200

; Specify the path to WinLIRC, such as C:\WinLIRC\winlirc.exe
WinLIRC_Path := A_ProgramFiles "\WinLIRC\winlirc.exe"

; Specify WinLIRC's address and port. The most common are 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and 8765.

; Configure your remote control's buttons below. Use WinLIRC's names
; for the buttons, which can be seen in your WinLIRC config file
; (.cf file) -- or you can press any button on your remote and the
